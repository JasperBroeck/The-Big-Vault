- **Speed**. Your base shuffling speed is 30 feet.
    
- **Always Obscured**. No matter how you look at them, a Muppetborn’s bottom half is always out of view. It’s said that even when one stands in the middle of a field, the earth will rise up to meet them. For this reason, they are always considered to have half cover and receive a permanent +2 bonus to AC
    
- **The Hand**. Muppetborn mythology speaks of The Hand inside each of them. They innately know the cantrip Mage Hand, however the floating hand can only lift up to five pounds and move up to five feet per character level.

#### **Hand of The Monster** +1 Charisma Increase

**Yaaaaay.** At 3rd level, you can perform the mighty roar of The Monster as a bonus action once per short rest. This gives a +5 bonus to the next attack each of your allies within 60 feet makes, as long as they do so in the next minute. Additionally, any ally that makes a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw in the next minute does so with advantage.

#### **Hand of The Grouch** +1 Strength Increase.

**Garbage ‘Can’, Not Garbage ‘Cannot’.** At 3rd level, you’ve learned to fortify yourself amongst the lowest of society and gain proficiency in medium and heavy armor. Additionally, you do not make stealth checks at disadvantage while wearing heavy armor if moving at half speed or slower. Finally, you gain advantage on stealth checks if blending in with filth or garbage.

#### **Hand of The Animal** +1 Wisdom Increase.

One Of Us. Many Muppetborn resemble animals. From birth, they have have advantage on animal handling checks with these animals and can communicate with them. At 3rd level, they can communicate with similar types of animals, and can also cast Beast Bond once per short or long rest without using a spell slot.
