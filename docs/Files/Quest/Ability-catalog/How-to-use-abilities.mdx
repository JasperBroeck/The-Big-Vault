# How to use abilities
Imagine: A mage floats above the
ground with their hands toward
the sky, causing a twisting gale to
sweep through the library. They
demonstrate their newly learned
magic as books and leaves fly
around the room.

Have you ever closed your eyes
and wished for something magical
to happen?

Perhaps to talk to animals, grow
wings and fly, become invisible,
or travel through time and space?

Quest is a magical place where
those things are possible.

In this section, you’ll discover all of
the special abilities that make each
role unique. In the next few pages,
you’ll learn important rules and
keywords that explain how abilities
work.

## Choosing abilities
Choose six abilities for your role
from this catalog before starting the
game. This is your starting set of
abilities, and you can use them in
your first session.

At the end of each game session,
you may choose one new ability to
learn from the catalog.

## Learning paths
Abilities belong to learning paths.
You must learn abilities in each
path in order, starting with the first
ability in each path.

You can learn abilities from all of
your learning paths. (You don’t
need to learn all of the abilities in
one path before learning abilities in
another one.)

For example, you could choose the
first ability from each path to start
the game, or learn a bunch from
one or two paths.

You can learn as many or as few
abilities in each path as you want,
as long as you learn new abilities in
order.

Let’s take the Ranger’s Friend path
as an example. In order, the Friend
path’s abilities are: Speak with
Animal, Animal Partner, Courier,
Pair Bond, and Whisper on the
Wind.

In this example, if you wanted to
learn Pair Bond, you’d have to
first learn Speak With Animal, then
Animal Partner, and then Courier.

## Legendary abilities
There are some abilities so
powerful and rare that you can
only learn them if your adventure
provides the opportunity. Your
Guide will decide when and how
your role’s legendary abilities can
be learned.

## Adventure points
If an ability in the catalog has an
activation cost, you must spend AP
to use that ability.

When you spend AP to activate
an ability, you must immediately
deduct it from your adventure point
balance.

Some abilities have one or more
ways they can be used. Each of
these is referred to as an option,
and each option has an AP cost.
For example, if an ability says
“Option A: 3 AP”, this option for the
ability costs 3 AP to use.

Some abilities have options with
varying AP costs. Here’s a fire spell
as an example:

## Ability: Create Flame
Option A: 2 AP. You create a small
bolt of flame.

Option B: 4 AP. You create a huge
fireball.

In this example, you could spend 2
AP to create a small bolt of flame,
or instead spend 4 AP to create
a huge fireball. If an activation
cost has an “X,” it means you may
choose how much AP to spend on
the ability.

If one of an ability’s options has an
activation cost of 0, you can use it
without spending any AP.

## The spy’s toolkit
The Spy is a master of practical
means and is the only role that
can craft bespoke magical items.
These items are listed in the
catalog alongside abilities, and the
Spy can acquire them at the end
of a session like you can any other
ability. However, these items can be
lost or broken like any other object.
The Spy may spend 2 AP to rebuild
a lost or broken item. Items must be
rebuilt during downtime in the story.

Other creatures may hold the Spy’s
items, but only the Spy can activate
their magic capabilities.

## “At the table”
If an ability asks you to do
something at the table, that means
doing it in the real world. If you
can’t do it, that’s okay; you may ask
another player to assist you, or just
ignore the requirement.

If you’re uncomfortable performing
one of the game’s abilities, like
reading poetry, you may describe
how your character performs the
ability instead of doing it yourself.

## “Roll the die”
If an ability says to roll the die, it
means you have to roll the die to
see what happens when you use it.
Any time you roll the die there is a
possibility of failure.

As usual, the Guide will decide
what the consequences of the die
roll are. But if an ability lists its own
set of special consequences, the
Guide will use those instead.

book.

NPCs and player characters.
