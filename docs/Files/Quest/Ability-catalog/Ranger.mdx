# The Ranger
The Ranger closes their eyes and
places their hand on a tree trunk,
learning the secrets of the forest.
They stop to chat with a local
squirrel, making a new friend. They
speak myth, earning the favor of
strangers.

The Ranger is a great choice for
people who want to play a skilled
hunter and survivalist who thrives
on the fringes of civilization.

If you want to start quickly, choose
the Commune, Read the Winds,
Speak with Animal, Animal Partner,
Track, and Remedy abilities.

## Story and Song
Story and Song learning path:
Commune, Folk Song, and Speak
Myth.

### Commune
1 AP. You use the language of
outland folks, gaining the trust of a
nearby commoner. You must invent
a local saying to exchange with the
NPC; it can be something like “It’s
raining cats and dogs” or “Don’t
judge a book by its cover.” Explain
what it means at the table.

Then, if you ask any of these
questions, the NPC w`ill answer to
the best of their ability.
• Is anyone causing trouble?
• Where can I find the leader?
• What are folks talking about
lately?

### Folk Song
2 AP. You sing a song that kindles
strong feelings in NPCs nearby.
(The song has no effect on hostile
creatures.)

Read or sing the chorus of a song
at the table and describe your
performance. You may write your
own or use one from another
songwriter. Choose a mood to set
for your audience:

Option A: Bright. Hearts swell with
friendly enthusiasm, sparking joyful
conversations.

Option B: Somber. The audience
falls silent and begins a sorrowful
reflection on their suffering.

Option C: Proud. Zealous feelings
are ignited, making the crowd noisy
and excitable.

### Speak Myth
3 AP. You appeal to a local myth to
gain the favor of a commoner. You
create the myth using four parts: an
obligation, a lesson, a subject, and
a story.

Part 1: Obligation. Decide how the
myth affects your target. Choose
one:
• They offer you and your allies
food, shelter, and secrecy in
their home.
• They offer you the best
reasonable trade on an item they
are selling.
• They go on a small mission, like
fetching an item or delivering a
message.
• They admit to a recent
wrongdoing.
• They forgive you for a
transgression.
• They spread a rumor you create.
• An obligation of your choice, as
long as it does not harm them.

Part 2: Lesson. Using the
obligation, say what the lesson
of the myth is, like “Give refuge
to strangers” or “Always be a fair
dealer.”

Part 3: Subject. Name a central
person or event.

Part 4: Story. Describe a dramatic
situation the person or event is
famous for. Perhaps they were a
missionary who fed the hungry or it
was a great flood that killed many.

Share the myth with your friends
at the table. You may reuse a
myth you have created without
describing it in full.

## Survivalist
Survivalist learning path: Remedy,
Shroud, Signal, and Ritual.

### Remedy
1 AP. You scavenge your area for
a short time to find a plant-based
remedy for an ailment. You find
enough for a single dose. The
remedy cures temporary illness and
eliminates poison.

### Shroud
3 AP. You entreat nearby flora to
provide the party with protection
while camping in wilderness. (There
must be plants nearby.) Shrubs and
thorny vines will emerge around the
campsite to provide concealment.
The shroud lasts until you leave the
camp.

The shroud conceals the light
from a small campfire. If hostile
creatures advance on the party’s
campsite, the trees will rustle
and howl to provide 5 minutes of
early warning. Creatures can pass
through the shroud, but they are hit
for 1 HP if they push through. When
you regroup inside of the Shroud,
your party gains the benefit of a
rest.

### Signal
4 AP. While in wilderness, you
create a distress signal that can be
seen by other Rangers. Describe
how you send your signal: it can
be a smoke signal, a message you
leave on a tree, or a similar act.

Within the next day, you will meet
an NPC Ranger who comes to
your aid. Out of respect for you as
a colleague, they will stay with you
until they finish helping you with a
request. Your request cannot be
unlimited, and they will not stay with
you forever.

The NPC Ranger has 10 hit points,
and comes with equipment of
the Guide’s choice. You can ask
them to do things, but they are an
independent character who will
ultimately act according to their own
interests and ideals.

### Ritual
4 AP. You scavenge your area for a
short time to find a single dose of a
magic edible. (There must be plants
in the area.)

When you ingest the edible, you
embark on an inner journey over
the next hour for supernatural
insight. You may learn the truth
about one of the following things:
• The safest or fastest way to get
somewhere.
• A place where your Nemesis
visited within the past day.
• Whether you are in a real place
or if your reality is some kind of
deception.
• Whether an ally is keeping a
secret from you. (You learn who
they are, but not what the secret
is.)

If an Invoker invites you along
when using their Invoke ability,
you may use Ritual to join them
on their journey to an astral plane.
The same rules of the Invoke ability
apply to you when joining the
Invoker.

## Pathfinder
Pathfinder learning path: Read the
Winds, Navigate, Delve, and Speak
with Trees.

### Read the Winds
Option A: 0 AP. You concentrate
on the language of wind, sensing
weather patterns in your region of
the world. You are able to glimpse
a weather forecast for the next few
days in your region of the world.

Option B: 2 AP. If you spend 2 AP
on this ability, you may choose the
weather that you foresee in your
region over the next few days, as
long as it is seasonally appropriate.
You might choose light rain, a
thunderstorm, fog, a heat wave, or
any other weather pattern, except
for natural disasters like tornadoes
or hurricanes.

### Navigate
Option A: 0 AP. You feel the land
in your bones. You cannot get
lost in wilderness unless magic is
inhibiting you.

Option B: 1 AP. You navigate your
party to one of these areas: an
oasis, a shelter, ruins, or a nest.

Oasis. You find a reprieve that has
a small amount of nourishment.

Shelter. You find a natural cave that
offers shelter from harsh weather.

Ruins. You find minor ruins, like
an abandoned keep or a withered
statue.

Nest. You find the home of an
animal or group of animals, like an
otter’s den.

###Delve
2 AP. You make a sound that
travels throughout an underground
structure, like a natural cave
system or dungeon. (You can clap,
make an animal noise, or anything
else that might echo.) You sense
the general layout of the next three
areas connected to yours, plus
the layout of any passageways
between these areas. The Guide
will draw you a rudimentary map,
noting any major features, like
columns, bridges, or crevasses.

### Speak with Trees
You touch a tree trunk, connecting
yourself to the trees of a contiguous
forest.

Option A: 2 AP. You ask the
tree to search the forest. For
example, you may ask to locate
a specific creature, an object
laying somewhere, or a location,
like a cave or building. The tree
will commune with its friends and
then tell you where it is, how to get
there, and how long it will take.

Option B: 2 AP. You ask the tree
to watch over the party. Until you
leave the forest, trees will begin to
sway and rustle if you approach a
trap or a dangerous creature. The
rustling increases as you draw
nearer to danger.

## Hunter
Hunter learning path: Track,
Farshot, Deadeye, Stalk, Nemesis.

### Track
Option A: 0 AP. When you find
tracks, you can instantly identify the
type of creature that left them. If it
is an animal, the Guide will share a
fact that you know about them, like
their habits or personality traits.

Option B: 1 AP. You can pick up
on the trail of an animal of your
choice even if there are no tracks
nearby, as long as it is native to the
environment you’re currently in.
You must choose a type of animal
to find, like a boar or a squirrel.
(You can’t use this to find a specific
creature.) You find the creature
after a short search.

### Farshot
1 AP. You briefly sharpen your
senses, surpassing your normal
limits. You can make a ranged
attack on a faraway target that you
can see, even if it is out of range.

### Deadeye
Option A: 0 AP. Whenever you roll a
20 with a ranged weapon, you can
name a specific limb on a creature
to hit with your projectile. The limb
becomes disabled and cannot be
used until it is restored by a healer.

Option B: 3 AP. You take aim and
focus your senses, automatically
scoring a triumph with a ranged
weapon on a nearby creature
or object that you target. The hit
disables the targeted limb.

### Stalk
Option A: 0 AP. You and your party
can carefully stalk tracked prey
without it noticing you, as long as
you try to be quiet. Describe the
formation of you and/or your party
as you go on the hunt.

Option B: 2 AP. When you discover
the creature or creatures you were
tracking, you can ambush them,
even if they were preparing to
ambush you. Your party takes the
first round, and you get an extra
turn.

### Nemesis
4 AP. Choose a specific creature
you have met before. You mark
them as your nemesis. You may
only have one nemesis at a time,
and you may freely remove the
mark at any time.

Your predatory senses allow you
to detect whenever your nemesis
is present in your scene, even if
they are hidden. You feel a tingle in
the temples of your forehead when
your nemesis is nearby.

You gain these additional benefits
when fighting your nemesis:
• They cannot surprise you by
ambush.
• You may use your Farshot ability
against them at will for no AP
cost.
• When they are nearby, you
can sense their location well
enough to strike them with
physical attacks, even if they are
concealed or invisible.

## Friend
Friend learning path: Speak with
Animal, Animal Partner, Courier,
Pair Bond, and Whisper on the
Wind.

### Speak with Animal
1 AP. You touch an animal that is
not currently hostile toward you,
forming a telepathic bond with it for
the next minute. You are capable of
interpreting the animal’s thoughts
and feelings, and you can have an
exchange of communication with it.
It can give basic information about
things, like how it feels, what it has
seen, and what it wants, but it does
not understand complex ideas.

### Animal Partner
4 AP. You recruit a nearby animal
companion who will follow your
orders to the best of its ability. It
can’t be smaller than a mouse or
bigger than a horse. You may only
have one partner at a time.

The animal is an NPC played by
the Guide that acts in addition
to you during your turn. It won’t
willingly leave your area, and if
you are separated, it will try to find
you. It cannot speak to you, but it
can vaguely sense your mood and
intentions.Your animal partner has
6 HP and can make basic attacks
for 2 damage.

### Courier
1 AP. You find a friendly animal
nearby and whisper to it, giving
it instructions to deliver an item.
The item must be small and
light enough for the animal to
reasonably carry. You can have the
animal deliver the item to a place or
a specific person. The destination
must be within a day’s travel time.

### Pair Bond
2 AP. You develop a unique
telepathic bond with your animal
partner that lasts until you recruit
a new one. You now passively
experience your partner’s senses;
you catch glimpses of what they
see, hear, and feel. You also feel a
shadow of pain whenever they are
harmed.

At any time, you may enter a trance
to leave your own body and take
control of your partner. You remain
dimly aware of what’s happening
around your own body. While in
the trance, you may control your
partner as if they were yourself,
though you cannot speak. You may
exit the trance at any time.

### Whisper on the Wind
4 AP. You whisper a message
carried by the wind in all directions.
You must have a clear sight line to
the sky for the spell to work. The
message summons a flying animal
to your location. You can petition
any kind of flying animal, like a
raven or a griffin.

The animal arrives one hour later.
As long as you are friendly to it, the
animal will obey your commands
for the next day. For example, you
can have it deliver messages, give
you a ride, or cause distractions.
The animal will not attack enemies
unless it is attacked first.

## Legendary
### Wild Celebrity
Your presence is now respected
by wild creatures everywhere. Wild
animals, except bosses, will no
longer attack you unless you harm
them. (Trained animals and pets
can still be commanded to harm
you.) You may now use the Speak
With Animal and Speak with Trees
abilities for no AP cost if you have
already learned them.

Your Animal Partner ability now
recruits a more powerful animal.
Your partner has 10 HP, can hit for
2 HP, and attack twice per turn.
If you have an existing animal
partner, it is upgraded to these
stats.

6 AP. You send a call while in
wilderness to recruit a small army
of animals. They stay with you for
the next day. You can choose any
combination of wild animals as
long as they are native to the area.
You may command them, and they
all act together during your turn.
The group is treated like a single
creature with 20 hit points, and they
collectively hit for 6 HP, distributed
among up to 6 targets.

## Slayer
4 AP. Your experience as a
Ranger has taught you to deal
with overwhelming odds. Once
per scene, you may devastate a
group of minions in an impressive
acrobatic fashion. You instantly kill
half of all nearby minions, rounding
up.

## Friend of the Land
You become the friend of a
wilderness region that has meaning
to you, like a forest or a valley. The
region cannot already be under the
control of a boss.

You are known to all living things in
this area as its ally. You may now
use the Shroud, Speak with Trees,
Navigate, Track, and Speak With
Animal abilities within your chosen
land for no AP cost, if you have
already learned them.

When you become the Friend of
the Land, a group of volunteer
creatures living in your chosen land
will create a natural fort for you in a
location of your choice. It takes one
week to create. It should resemble
in spirit something animals might
create, like a giant ant hill, a
meerkat manor, a nest in the trees,
or a beaver’s dam. It has up to 20
rooms, including a kitchen, a great
hall, and an armory. The keep is
watched over full-time by allied
animal sentries who will notify you
of intruders or guests.

Additionally, a small staff of
volunteer animals will routinely
forage for you, making sure the
keep is stocked with vegetables,
fruits, and other natural foods from
the area that they can collect. They
will occasionally invite you to play
with them.
