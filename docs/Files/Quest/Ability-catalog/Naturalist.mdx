# The Naturalist
The Naturalist whispers to a field
of flowers, inspiring them to bloom.
They take a wolf’s form, streaking
across the steppe. With their hands
to the sky, they summon a storm,
bringing forth nature’s wrath.

Play The Naturalist if you want to
explore an intimate bond with the
wild creatures and raw elemental
forces of your world.

If you want to start quickly, choose
the Animal Form, Thorn, Freeze,
Cloudcall, Wild Aspect, and
Command Nature abilities.

## Shapeshifter
Shapeshifter learning path: Animal
Form, Gills, Steelsprout, Petrify,
and Shapeshift.

### Animal Form
2 AP. You take the form of a wild
animal, adopting its shape, senses,
and range of motion. You may
choose any creature that is no
smaller than a mouse and no larger
than a horse. Everything you carry
becomes part of your animal form.

While in animal form, you have 6
HP. You may make basic attacks
that hit for 2 HP. You can’t cast
spells, use items, or speak
languages while transformed.

You can return to your normal form
at any time. When transforming
back, you regain the hit points you
had before you transformed. Falling
to 0 hit points while transformed
instantly returns you to your normal
form.

### Gills
1 AP. You enchant a small amount
of water in a container that you
are holding. When you spritz the
water on a creature, they grow
small but visible gills, allowing them
to breathe underwater for up to 1
hour. This spell enchants enough
water to use 6 times.

### Steelsprout
2 AP. You extend your hand and
close your eyes, permanently
turning a nearby metal object
into a weave of delicate plants.
(The object cannot have magical
properties or be larger than a door.)
Describe the plants that the object
turns into.

### Petrify
2 AP. You turn the surface of a
nearby commoner or minion to
stone for the next minute. The target
cannot move, see, hear, or speak
during this time. The creature has
50 hit points while petrified. If its hit
points are reduced to 0 during the
spell, it shatters to pieces and dies.

2 AP. You encase your armor or
clothing with a chitinous shell. The
shell absorbs up to 10 hit points
of damage. If you were hit by a
non-magical weapon, the weapon
shatters to pieces. The carapace
crumbles away immediately after it
takes damage. You may cast this
spell as a reaction to an incoming
attack during another creature’s
turn.`

### Shapeshift
3 AP. This is a master version of
your Animal Form spell. The rules
are the same, except for these
differences:

• You can choose a creature no
smaller than a housefly and no
larger than an elephant.
• You have 10 HP in animal form.
• Your animal form attacks hit for
3 HP.
• You can send messages
telepathically to members of the
party.

## Summoner
Summoner learning path: Thorn,
Wild Font, Evening Star, Aurora,
and Echoes of Creation.

### Thorn
Roll the die. 0 AP. You open your
palm, conjuring a poisonous thorn
that you shoot in a straight line
toward a nearby target creature or
object. The thorn hits for 2 HP.

If you roll a 20, the thorn’s poison
is amplified. If you hit an organic
creature, its skin becomes swollen,
it cannot see beyond its reach, and
it can’t speak or cast spells until the
end of its next turn.

### Wild Font
1 AP. You touch a container holding
food, water, or oil. For the next
minute, the container summons a
surplus of its contents, spilling the
excess material out generously.
For example, if you touch a pitcher
of water, it will overflow and cover
the floor. Or if you touch a sack of
grain, it will burst open, creating a
large pile.

### Evening Star
2 AP. You summon a wisp of light
high in the sky directly above you.
(You must be outdoors to cast this
spell.) For the next hour, the wisp
sheds light on a huge area, allowing
you to see far in the distance. It
matches your movement such that
it is always located above you. The
area the light touches looks as if it
were lit by daylight.

### Aurora
5 AP. Your eyes glitter like dancing
wisps as you conjure a dazzling
prismatic aurora above you in
the sky. The aurora is visible to
creatures up to a kilometer away
and lasts for the next 10 minutes.

Commoners. Any common folk who
can see the aurora are dazzled and
stop what they are doing to stare at
it.

Minions. Minions are also dazzled
by the spell and stop what they are
doing to stare at it. Hitting a minion
frees them from the spell’s effects.

Bosses. The Guide must roll the
die. On 2 to 10, bosses are dazzled
and must choose between moving
and acting during their turn. On a 1,
they are stunned in place until the
spell ends or if they are hit.

### Echoes of Creation
6 AP. You hum a reverberating
melody, summoning a coterie of
magical wisps from the ages of
creation. The wisps were powerful
beings of light who once roamed
the omniverse. Now, like dying
stars, these ethereal remnants are
burning the last of their energy.
They are no longer sentient, but
seem to sense the world around
them. For the next minute, the
wisps float about the area, restoring
the hit points of all creatures and
animating new plant life. Every
creature in the scene stops what
they are doing while the wisps are
present and remain still with awe
until they fade to the beyond.

## Elementalist
Elementalist learning path: Freeze,
Burn, Shock, and Fireball.

### Freeze
Option A: 0 AP. You blow cool air,
creating freezing winds that swirl
around a nearby creature or object.
Affected creatures feel a deep chill
in their bones and are hit for 1 HP.
You can use the spell to snuff out
small fires.

Option B: 2 AP. You freeze a nearby
commoner, minion, or object,
encasing it in ice until you leave
the scene. If you freeze a creature,
it cannot move or act. The ice
shatters, and the creature is freed if
it takes any additional damage.

### Burn
Option A: 0 AP. You blow hot air,
creating scorching winds that swirl
around a nearby creature or object.
The heat is enough to make the
creatures very uncomfortable but
not enough to harm them.

Option B: 1 AP. You overcharge the
spell and ignite the target in flame
instead, hitting it for 2 damage and
setting it ablaze.

### Shock
4 AP. Choose a target creature
or object you can see. A bolt of
lightning strikes it from the sky or
from your hands, dealing 8 damage
and creating a deafening blast of
thunder. If the creature has metal
connected to their body, it becomes
molten, hitting them for an extra 2
HP.

### Fireball
Roll the die. 5 AP. You shape an
orb of fire suspended in the air in
front of you and send it streaking in
a straight line toward a target you
can see. The fireball explodes on
contact, dealing 6 damage to any
creatures and objects it hits. You
can shape the spell to avoid allies
or creatures you do not want to
harm.

• If you roll a 20, the explosion hits
all creatures near the point of
impact for double damage.
• If you roll an 11 to 19, the
explosion hits up to 4 creatures
near the point of impact.
• If you roll 6 to 10, choose one:
the explosion hits you and up
to 4 creatures near impact, or
the fireball fizzles into a cloud of
smoke.
• On 2 to 5, the fireball misses
and hits random targets of the
Guide’s choice.
• On a 1, the fireball explodes in
your face, hitting you and up to 3
nearby creatures.

## Stormcaller
Stormcaller learning path:
Cloudcall, Vortex, Gale, Riverfury,
and Stormcall.

### Cloudcall
1 AP. You swirl your hands in the
air, producing a thick fog centered
on you. The fog rolls out rapidly,
spilling around corners and down
slopes. Within a few seconds, you
blanket everything nearby in fog.
Creatures inside the fog cannot
see beyond their reach, preventing
them from making ranged attacks.
The fog disperses after you leave
the area, or if the area is hit by
strong winds.

### Vortex
2 AP. You create a howling vortex
within a body of liquid that you can
see. The vortex lasts until you leave
the area. Any creatures touching
the vortex are violently sucked in,
submerged, and then spit out, each
taking 2 damage.

### Gale
3 AP. You close your eyes and stir
the air, shaping the winds around
you. A gale forms that you can
spread across an area of any size
and shape in your scene, as long
as you can see its area of effect.
Inside the area of effect, wind blows
at ferocious speeds, kicking up dust
and sending small objects flying.
Creatures inside can’t see far away,
only what’s nearby.

When you begin the spell, the gust
knocks creatures to the ground and
sends them tumbling backward
until they leave the area of effect.
Creatures outside of the gust
cannot enter it unless they are
larger than the area of effect.

### Riverfury
4 AP. You whisper a magical
incantation to a flowing river within
range. The river gathers a surge
of strength upstream. A torrent of
water arrives at your location in
the path of the river 15 seconds
later. All creatures caught in the
torrent are swept downstream
and deposited on shore far away,
beyond where you can see.

### Stormcall
Option A: 2 AP. You produce a circle
of dark, electrically charged clouds
somewhere you can see in the sky.
The storm lasts until you leave the
scene. While the storm is active,
you may call upon it to produce
these effects:

Option B: 1 AP. You cause a
downpour.

Option C: 1 AP. A deafening crack
of thunder shakes the ground. All
creatures under the storm cannot
hear anything beyond their reach
until the end of the scene.

Option D: 3 AP. If you have learned
the Shock ability, you may use it for
3 AP.

Option E: X AP. A bolt of chain
lightning rips through NPCs you
can see, hitting them each for 4 HP.
Spend 1 AP per target.

## Spiritcaller
Spiritcaller learning path: Wild
Aspect, Prey Sense, and Nature’s
Watch.

### Wild Aspect
Option A: 1 AP. Eagle. You gain
eagle-eye vision for the next
minute. You can see anything in
your line of sight clearly, even if
it is far away, and you can detect
faraway movement that would be
imperceptible to a normal person.

Option B: 2 AP. Cat. You purr softly
under your breath, imbuing up to 6
nearby creatures with the spirit of
the cat. For the next hour, affected
creatures gain the ability to see
things nearby in complete darkness
as if they were in a dimly lit room.
The effect cannot pierce magical
darkness. Affected creatures may
occasionally feel the urge to stop
what they are doing and clean
themselves.

Option C: 2 AP. Wolf. You howl,
imbuing up to 6 nearby creatures
with haste. (Howl at the table.) For
the next hour, creatures affected
by the spell can outrun any other
creatures while traveling by foot.

### Prey Sense
1 AP. You sharpen your sense of
danger for the next hour. You feel a
subtle signal in your body whenever
you will imminently be threatened
by another creature. (The hair on
your skin might raise, or you might
feel a tingling in your bones.) This
includes creatures that you can’t
see.

If you detect a creature this way,
your party cannot be ambushed.
(If you detect a creature trying to
attack you, your party gets the first
round in combat.)

### Nature’s Watch
3 AP. You extend your senses for
the next hour. Choose two options
each time you use this ability:

Option A: Aurasight. Detect a faint
outline around anything that is
currently affected by a spell.

Option B: Infrasight. Detect objects
nearby whose relative heat makes
them stand out, like creatures with
warm bodies. This works through
walls.

Option C: Darksight. See in
darkness nearby as if it were dimly
lit.

Option D: Mirrorsight. See around
corners inside of enclosed spaces,
like buildings. You must be within
reach of the corner. (For example,
you can see around the bend of a
hallway.)

Option E: Realsight. Detect whether
something is an illusion. Illusions
you detect with this spell appear to
flicker.

## Ecologist
Ecologist learning path: Command
Nature, Memories of Stone, and
Shift Season.

### Command Nature
Option A: 0 AP. You whisper a
rhyming couplet to the living plants
around you. You can write your
own or borrow one from another
author. Use one that plants might
appreciate, like “Hear my voice
ring, and welcome the spring.”

Your brief poem entreats the plants
to produce a harmless effect by
moving or growing slightly. The
things you want to manipulate
must be within range. You may
make trees rustle, cause leaves to
fall, get plants to bloom, vines to
expand, and seeds to sprout.

Option B: 1 AP. If you can explain
how, you can have the effect deal
2 HP of damage to a nearby target.
For example, you might have vines
grow thorns and lash a creature,
or have a tree shake its acorns on
their head violently.

### Memories of Stone
3 AP. If you encounter a stone
monument, like a mountain,
canyon, or statue, you may touch it
to channel its ancient wisdom. You
must tell the stone a story about
your family — perhaps a memory of
a gathering, like a holiday. Give this
story at the table.

The monument reciprocates your
offering by sharing its wisdom.
• You sense whether this world is
real and natural, or some kind of
machination.
• You sense whether there are any
long-lost monuments beneath
the surface, like hidden temples
or ancient vaults.
• You vaguely sense the most
powerful lost artifact in this world
and the region where it might be
located.

### Shift Season
Roll the die. 4 AP. You manipulate
the elements to change the current
season everywhere within 1
kilometer of your location. You can
choose any season for the world
you inhabit, and the effect lasts
for the next day. The spell takes a
minute to cast; the effect emanates
rapidly from your location. The
weather inside the zone will be
unpredictable, but typical of the
season you choose. For example, if
you turn a hot season to a cold one,
you may bring snow.

• If you roll a 20, you choose the
season and may also choose
the weather inside the area
(excluding natural disasters like
hurricanes). The effect lasts for
one month.
• On 11 to 19, you choose
the season and the weather
(excluding disasters).
• On 6 to 10, you choose the
season.
• On 2 to 5, the Guide chooses
the season, and a storm begins
to affect the region that makes
travel more difficult.
• On a 1, you accidentally cause
a natural disaster to form. The
Guide chooses the disaster.

## Legendary
### Nature’s Wrath
7 AP. You channel elemental fury.
You create a storm centered on you
with a radius of 1 kilometer. It lasts
as long as you wish to channel it,
but you take 1 HP of damage for
each turn you spend maintaining
the spell. You may choose the size
of the storm eye, which is safe
inside. Choose the nature of the
disaster each time you cast this
spell:

Option A: Lightning. Electricity
streaks through the storm, arcing
through conductive objects and
lashing any NPCs caught in it. Each
NPC caught in the storm is hit for
2 HP during each turn you cast the
spell.

Option B: Blizzard. Water
condenses in the storm field,
turning into apple-sized balls of
hail. The air temperature in the
storm field is freezing. NPCs in the
storm field are hit for 1 HP during
each turn you maintain the spell.
Creatures cannot see beyond their
reach in the howling whirl of ice.

Option C: Hurricane. Sustained
winds of terrifying force whip
through the storm field. Weak
buildings are completely destroyed,
all windows are shattered, many
roofs will cave in, and trees may be
uprooted. Most unsecured objects
are picked up by the storm and sent
flying far away. Any NPCs caught
in the storm field are blown around,
can’t move, and are hit for 4 HP for
each turn you cast the spell.

### Wild Evolution
Your physical essence becomes
permanently intertwined with that of
a chosen animal’s form. The animal
can be no smaller than a mouse
and no larger than an elephant. You
may only choose this form once.

You may morph back and forth
between your original form and
your chosen form at will. When
you change between forms, you
maintain your current hit points.

You adopt the animal’s natural
capabilities while you are
transformed. For example, if you
transform into an eagle, you may
fly. Your basic attacks in animal
form hit for 3 damage.

You may now cast spells in animal
form and speak telepathically to
your allies.

You can still use the Animal Form
and Shapeshift abilities, and the
rules for those abilities still function
as usual.

### To Dust
3 AP. You return a crafted object to
nature, instantly reducing it to dust.

The object must be small enough to
fit inside a 10x10-meter cube. The
transformation is permanent and
cannot be reversed.

### World Wish
You become the seed for a new
world. Casting this spell consumes
your life forever; you can never be
brought back.

Your entire knowledge of nature
manifests in the spell. When you
cast it, your body dissipates in
radiant light, becoming a cascading
wave of energy that transforms
the planet you are on. The wave of
energy first alters the atmosphere,
making it capable of supporting life
if it is not already suitable.

Then, a blooming cascade of
living flora emanates from your
location, rapidly growing and
overtaking the planet’s surface.
The bloom radiates outward from
your location until the entire planet
is transformed. The spell forms
oceans and rivers if they do not
already exist.

If you choose at the time of
casting, the spell disintegrates any
constructed objects, like buildings
or infrastructure, returning the land
to nature. Any objects that are
destroyed in this way are done so
gracefully, such that existing living
things, like people and animals, are
lowered to the ground unharmed.

This is a permanent transformation
that cannot be stopped, interrupted,
or reversed by countermagic.
