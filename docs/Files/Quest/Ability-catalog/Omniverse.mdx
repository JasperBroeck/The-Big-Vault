# The Omniverse
## The omniverse
Imagine an infinite cascade of
universes, like lily pads spread
across an endless lake. The
universe of your story is one of
them. Each universe is made up of
a series of planes, and all universes
are connected through an astral
plane called The Rift.

## Worldly plane
The worldly plane is the primary
plane in each universe. It is the
realm of your conscious existence
— the ordinary reality of space,
time, matter, and energy. Most
stories in this game begin in the
Worldly Plane. Access to other
universes and planes requires the
use of powerful magic.

There are infinite numbers of
worldly planes in alternate possible
universes.

## Shadow plane
Beneath the worldly plane, there
are shadow planes: independent
dimensions of time and space.
They can only be created and
accessed by using magic.

Think of them like ships in a bottle.
Each shadow plane can be filled
with anything — from a single
room surrounded by darkness to a
convincing illusion of the real world.

## The Rift
The Rift is an astral plane that
exists between universes. It is the
nexus — the planar transitway
— between an infinite number of
parallel realities. It is the lake where
the lily pads lie.

Creatures perceive The Rift like
a series of vast islands, some as
large as continents or planets,
situated on the inside surface of
a brilliant celestial sphere. Each
island in The Rift is a door to a
possible universe. The Rift is
home to entire civilizations, godlike
creatures, and many other beings
who are spread across its expanse.

## The Beyond
The Beyond is the outer plane,
the omniverse, that encircles all
possible universes. It is the source
of the magical energy that weaves
through all of the omniverse’s
endless realities. It is an
incomprehensible space where all
possible existences simultaneously
occur and time stands still.

Each time a group of players sits
down to tell a story in Quest, they
create a new part of the omniverse.
That means every story told in this
game is connected. Characters can
even travel between stories if given
the chance.
