# The Spy
The Spy smiles and offers an
uncanny greeting, walking through
the front door with confidence. They
slip in and out of the shadows,
striking foes when they least expect
it. They craft remarkable, bespoke
tools that give them an edge in their
pursuits.

You should play The Spy if you
want to roleplay a supremely skilled
character who relies on practical
means to achieve their aims. It’s
a great choice for playing a secret
agent or roguish assassin.

If you want to start quickly, choose
the Cosmopolitan, Sneak Attack,
Strap, Tracker, Persona, and
Feather Hook abilities.

## Charisma
Charisma learning path:
Cosmopolitan, Silver Tongue, and
Don’t you know who I am?

### Cosmopolitan
0 AP. You are an expert in the
study of cosmopolitan cultures,
particularly in cities and nations.
If you are falsely presenting as a
citizen or official of a city or nation
and your authenticity is challenged,
you may use a local mannerism to
fool common people.

You must come up with the
mannerism and describe it to the
table. It can be a gesture, like a
special handshake, a common
saying, or some other idiosyncrasy
from the people you are pretending
to belong to.

### Silver Tongue
1 AP. If you are caught doing
something prohibited or
mischevious, you can use clever
thinking to evade suspicion.

You must appeal to something that
your adversaries find agreeable.
The Guide will choose one of these
as the right answer, and secretly
write it down:

Secret answer A: Orders. Someone
with authority commanded you to
do it.

Secret answer B: Ignorance. You
didn’t know better. It was a genuine
mixup!

Secret answer C: Graft. You offer
something of value from your
inventory to make this go away.

You must guess the right approach,
and describe how you make the
appeal.

For an additional 1 AP, the Guide
eliminates one of the incorrect
choices.

After you give your story, the
Guide will reveal the choice they
wrote. If you guess correctly, your
adversaries will leave you alone.

### Don’t you know who I am?
1 AP. You impress common folk
and minions by pretending to be
someone notable.

You initiate the ruse by giving a
special wink to a party member.
Then, each of your nearby party
members must proclaim an
incredible fact that creates your
identity. For example, a party
member might begin by calling
attention to you as a fabled writer,
a storied warrior, or a sports hero.
The other members of the party
should build on this fake identity
until everyone has contributed.
Each claim should be more
fantastical than the previous one.

When everyone is finished, you
draw a captive audience of nearby
creatures who crowd around you.

## Termination
Termination learning path: Sneak
Attack, Poison, Death Hand, and
Bounty.

### Sneak Attack
Once per round, when a nearby
foe attacks a creature other than
you, you may exploit their focus.
You may immediately move
behind them to perform one of the
following actions:

Option A: 1 AP. You make a basic
attack on them.

Option B: 1 AP. You incapacitate a
commoner or minion by touching
one of their pressure points. They
fall to the ground unconscious for
the next 10 minutes, or until they
are harmed.

Option C: 3 AP. You kill a
commoner or minion instantly.
Describe how you take them out.

### Poison
You combine basic goods from any
well-stocked general store to create
poison. You create enough poison
for one use. You can apply it to
weapons, put it in drinks or meals,
or serve it to a creature directly.
Regardless of delivery method,
each use of the poison can only
affect one creature. Choose any
combination of effects:

Option A: 1 AP. Blue poison. The
victim falls asleep for 1 hour.

Option B: 2 AP. White poison. The
victim writhes in extreme pain for 1
hour and is unable to speak.

Option C: 3 AP. Purple poison. The
victim collapses and is paralyzed
for the next day.

Option D: 4 AP. Black poison.
Commoners and minions are
instantly killed. Bosses are hit for
10 HP.

Option E: 6 AP. Clear poison. The
victim experiences no symptoms
and dies 1 week later. (This does
not work on bosses.)

### Death Hand
Magic item. A single-shot hand
cannon that uses a silent magic
charge to propel a slug. The Death
Hand can sense your target and
guide your hand to make a perfect
shot on any target you can see in
your scene, including those that
are far away. The shot hits for 6
HP. It instantly kills commoners and
minions.

3 AP. You must spend 3 AP and one
turn each time you recharge the
weapon.

### Bounty
Roll the die. 5 AP. You place a
bounty on a commoner or minion’s
head for their capture or death.
You must offer an item of value as
a reward in addition to the AP cost
of this ability that is at least rare in
quality. Bounty hunters will compete
for the prize.

If for capture, you may specify
where they are to be taken. If you
mark them for death, you may
require any manner of proof that
the deed was done.

• If you roll a 20, the deed will be
done by the end of your play
session.
• On 11 to 19, the deed will be
done by the end of your next
play session.
• On 1 to 10, the target learns of
the bounty and places one on
your head. You are not sure who
bounty hunters will reach first.

## Concealment
Concealment learning path: Strap,
Disguise, Blink Pack, Needful Hilt,
and Shadow.

### Strap
0 AP. Unless you are actively
searched by another creature, you
can conceal up to two weapons in
your clothing without being noticed,
provided you’re wearing enough to
reasonably conceal them.

### Disguise
1 AP. Any time you are in a
room like a bedroom, armory, or
office, you may find objects to
use to put together a convincing
disguise. Depending on where
you are, the disguise will offer at
least one signature element of
your deception, like a uniform, a
membership insignia, or a style of
dress. The disguise automatically
fools commoners, but minions and
bosses may question you.

### Blink Pack
Magic item. A magical messenger
pack with a hidden switch in the
clasp. When activated, the switch
turns the bag’s mouth into a portal
to a shadow plane where secret
objects may be stored. When the
switch is deactivated, the bag
functions normally. Spy items
stored in the pack do not count
against your inventory limit. (This
allows you to carry more than 12
items.)

The pack is paired with a magic
amulet that has a button on it.

3 AP. You press the button on the
amulet. The Blink Pack is teleported
to your hands from wherever it is in
the omniverse.

### Needful Hilt
Magic item. A hilt to a basic
weapon, like a sword or dagger.

0 AP. If you imagine a common
weapon while holding it, the hilt
instantly morphs into that weapon.
It hits for 2 HP in any form. When
you no longer need the weapon, it
reverts to its form as a simple hilt.

### Shadow
Magic item. A magic cape that
makes everything but your shadow
invisible.

2 AP. When you activate the cape’s
ability, it shimmers and sparkles
briefly before you and everything
you are carrying vanishes. You are
invisible for the next minute, but
you still cast a shadow when you
move. The shadow disappears
when you are still.

While invisible, common folk and
minions won’t notice you passing
by unless you make a lot of noise. If
you attack while invisible, the cape
deactivates and you become visible
again.

## Surveillance
Surveillance learning path: Tracker,
Spyglasses, Cloner, and Seeker.

### Tracker
Magic item. A pair of devices that
allows you to track something.

The kit includes a magical tag the
size of a tiny bead that is sticky and
can be applied to most surfaces.
The tracker is linked to a magic
compass that shows the direction
the tag is in.

The arrow on the compass is black.
It turns gold when the tag is in your
scene, and begins to vibrate softly.

### Spyglasses
Magic item. Eyeglasses that let
you see in natural darkness as if it
were daylight. The glasses can be
permanently upgraded with these
capabilities:

Upgrade A: 3 AP. Add the ability to
magnify the details of small nearby
objects, or zoom to see faraway
things clearly.

Upgrade B: 4 AP. Add infrared
vision that lets you see an outline
of things that are generating heat
nearby. This ability works through
walls.

Upgrade C: 6 AP. Add the ability
to detect whether something is an
illusion. Illusions you detect appear
to flicker and distort.

Upgrade D: 0 AP. Each of these
modes can be toggled while
wearing the Spyglasses by turning
a dial on the side of the device.

### Cloner
Magic item. A magic amulet that
allows you to eavesdrop on a
communications device.

0 AP. When holding the Cloner next
to a spell or object that transmits
communications, you may clone
its signal. You share a telepathic
link with the Cloner, and you
automatically hear any messages
being transmitted through the
cloned device in your mind. You
may only clone one device at a
time; pairing the Cloner with a new
device will break the link with the
previous one.

### Seeker
Magic item. The Seeker is a
levitating orb as large as the palm
of your hand that responds to
your commands telepathically. It
shimmers and is almost invisible,
but it makes a low humming noise
as it moves.

Option A: 0 AP. You can make the
Seeker travel just out of your sight
or to an adjacent room. It can tell
you how many creatures are in a
space, but not what kinds.

Option B: 1 AP. The Seeker gives
you a rudimentary mental map
of an adjacent room. The Guide
will draw an outline of the room,
highlight any major features (like
columns or crevasses), and mark
the exact location of any creatures.

## Stenography
Stenography learning path: Dossier,
Mimic, Listener, and Crypto.

### Dossier
Magic item. A magic book that
copies things. You can make a
Dossier of any size — from a
pocket-sized folio to a coffee table
book.

0 AP. You can use the book to copy
any kind of writing or drawing that
is pressed against its pages. For
instance, if you press a handwritten
letter against one of the Dossier’s
pages, a legible but imperfect copy
will appear inside.

### Mimic
Magic item. A magical pen that
guides your hand to copy any
writer’s personal style. On the end
opposite the pen tip is a magical
stamp that can create forgeries
of official seals.By bringing the
Mimic within reach of a handwritten
document, it automatically learns
how to reproduce the document’s
handwriting styles, signatures, and
seals.

2 AP. You use Mimic to create a
single document forged in any style
the pen has previously learned,
including the reproduction of any
official stamps or seals.

### Listener
Magic item. A small magic gem
that can be activated to record
sounds nearby for up to 1 hour.
If you have the Cloner, you can
insert the Listener into a socket on
the amulet. When they are paired,
you can have the Listener record
sounds that the Cloner intercepts.
The device can record up to 1 hour
of sound, and you can squeeze it
softly to have it audibly play back
the sound. Using the device to
record makes it completely forget
the previous recording.

1 AP. You activate the Listener. It
records anything it hears, paying
particular attention to spoken
words.

### Crypto
Magic item. Crypto is a ring of
opaque glass that glows when
brought near glyphs, like writing on
a piece of paper or stone etchings.

3 AP. You activate Crypto to
translate languages or decode
secret messages. The ring reads
any object you bring within reach.
A translation of the source material
emerges, scrolling around the band
as you read it. When it is finished
translating something, the ring
deactivates.

## Infiltration
Infiltration learning path: Feather H
ook, Bricolage, Needful Key, and
Blueprint.

### Feather Hook
Magic item. A magical grappling
hook that gently glides itself
upward, like a balloon, until it
reaches and attaches to a ledge.
You can tie any length of rope to
the hook.

0 AP. Activate the Feather Hook.

### Bricolage
1 AP. Your skills of improvisation
are unparalleled. When you are in a
room with everyday objects at your
disposal, you may hastily craft one
of the following items in less than 1
minute:

Option A: tripwire. You create a wire
attached to an auditory trigger that
makes a loud noise when someone
crosses it.

Option B: poison trap. If you have
poison, you may create a small
floor trap that poisons the first
creature to step on it.

Option C: simple weapon. You
fashion a makeshift weapon that
hits for 2 HP.

Option D: periscope. You can make
a small periscope that allows you to
look over objects and around doors
that have a bit of clearance.

### Needful Key
Magic item. A key that magically
senses the mechanism of a
physical lock and morphs itself to
fit it perfectly. In its default form,
the device is a simple key with no
teeth. By twisting the key’s handle,
you can make it revert to its default
form.

2 AP. The key morphs to fit a new
lock. You must spend 2 AP each
time you make the key morph to
fit a new lock. The key remembers
locks it has previously defeated
and can morph to fit them for no AP
cost.

### Blueprint
Magic item. A magical folio that
reveals the floorplan of a building.

2 AP. You press the Blueprint
against an interior wall of a building.
Magic ink appears, revealing the
building’s layout for the entire floor
you are currently on.

The Guide will draw you a basic
map of the building, including an
outline showing the shape of rooms
and hallways and marks showing
where doors and windows are. The
Blueprint only works on artificial
structures. (It does not reveal the
layout of caves or other natural
systems.)

If you also have the Seeker, the
Blueprint can show its location in
real time, as well as the location
of any nearby creatures that the
Seeker detects.

## Impersonation
Impersonation learning path:
Persona.

### Persona
You carefully prepare a convincing
alternate identity. You cannot create
a persona of an existing person or
the identity of someone who holds
an exclusive position, like the ruler
of an existing nation.

Each persona consists of a
wardrobe, credentials, and a
backstory. You may create and
describe each element of the
persona.

When you use your alternate
identity, you must outwardly present
yourself as that person by wearing
their costume.

Option A: 2 AP. You create the
persona of a common person of
average means, like a farmer,
artisan, traveling salesperson,
priest, soldier, or teacher.

When using a commoner’s identity,
you can effortlessly blend into
crowds and travel unnoticed in
public spaces.

Option B: 4 AP. You create the
persona of an officer (someone in
a position of formal authority), like
a politician, judge, military officer,
guild leader, or ship captain.

When using an officer’s identity,
you may:

• Enter restricted areas that your
rank and affiliation gives you
access to.
• Give mundane orders to people
you outrank, like running errands
or keeping watch.

Option C: 6 AP. You create the
persona of an aristocrat, like
a prominent socialite, wealthy
business owner, ambassador, or
governor.

When using an aristocrat’s identity,
you may:

• Enter exclusive spaces for the
rich and famous, like private
clubs or balls.
• Seek audience with local rulers.
• Spend 1 AP for a get out of jail
free card that pardons you for
minor crimes.

## Legendary
### Shadow Cutter
Magic item. The Shadow Cutter is
a wearable bracelet that you can
stretch to form a hoop large enough
to crawl through.

3 AP. When you press the device
against a solid surface, it can be
activated to create a hole of an
equal circumference, up to 1 meter
deep. When you’re done using it, it
collapses to its original size.

When activated, a low buzzing
sound can be heard by all creatures
nearby. The material behind the
device is instantly teleported to a
random shadow plane.

### The Artifice
Magic item. A small mask that
projects an illusion, transforming
your image and voice. The mask
records the appearance and voice
of every nearby creature you
encounter and remembers them
forever.

2 AP. You activate the mask,
projecting a convincing illusion that
gives you the appearance of any
creature it remembers. Additionally,
it changes your voice to sound like
the creature you’re impersonating.
It is capable of fooling everyone but
the impersonated creature’s closest
friends and family.

### Nightcrawler
You are a legendary charmer and
intelligence gatherer, capable
of quickly extracting sensitive
information.

4 AP. When you infiltrate a person’s
office, encampment, or home, you
discover sensitive information about
them. The Guide chooses two
things from this list to reveal to you:

• The identity of an important
associate.
• A location they will travel to, with
the time and date.
• A secret that would embarrass
them if revealed.
• Their financial situation,
including who they owe their
largest debt to or who owes
them the largest debt.
• Their true feelings about you or
your party.
• Their strongest allegiance,
whether to a government, guild,
or other organization.

The Guide will imagine the specifics
of the information you receive. They
will also choose the document that
reveals it, like a receipt, a diary, or
a letter.
