# The Doctor
The Doctor gently touches the arm
of an ally, mending their body and
spirit. They lean down to examine
the dead, discovering what caused
their cruel fate. They sense the
departed and speak with lost souls.

The Doctor is a good choice for
people who want to be the party’s
healer or someone who plays with
the forces of life and death.

If you want to start quickly, choose
the Mend, Sleep, Deathsense,
Corrupt, Modulate, and Examine
the Dead abilities.

## Healing
Healing learning path: Mend,
Relieve, Heal, and Restore.

### Mend
1 AP. You gently touch a creature,
immediately restoring 5 HP and
mending minor wounds like cuts
and bruises. The spell does
not remove impairments, heal
permanent wounds, or cure
disease. You cannot use this spell
during combat.

### Relieve
1 AP. You say something
comforting to a nearby creature,
alleviating them of anxiety, pain,
and discomfort for one hour. In
this state, the creature cannot be
affected by fear or confusion. For a
brief time, they feel better than they
have ever felt before.

### Heal
2 AP. You embrace a creature with
a caring touch, restoring all of their
hit points. After a short time, the
creature is relieved of any short-
term impairments. The spell does
not remove permanent conditions.
If you are using Heal on another
member of the party, they may
contribute any amount of their own
AP to help pay for the spell.

### Restore
7 AP. You touch a living creature,
completely restoring them to their
normal state over the next few
minutes. (You cannot cast this spell
while in combat.) The spell restores
all hit points and removes any
harm or damage. If you are using
Restore on another member of
the party, they may contribute any
amount of their own AP to help pay
for the spell.

## Alteration
Alteration learning path: Sleep,
Calcify, Feign Death, Reshape, and
Lifelink.

### Sleep
2 AP. You whisper a brief lullaby,
putting any number of nearby
commoners to sleep for up to one
hour. You can write your own lullaby
or borrow one from another author.
Read it at the table.

Creatures affected by the spell
collapse and enter a dreamful state,
but wake up immediately if they are
harmed.

X AP. You can intensify the spell
to affect nearby minions. Add 1 AP
for each minion you wish to put to
sleep.

### Calcify
1 AP. You touch a creature within
range, causing its surface to swell
and harden. During this time, they
feel numb to external pain. Their
hardened shell absorbs up to 2 HP
from physical hits. Any damage
dealt in excess of 2 HP hits the
creature normally. The creature’s
skin returns to normal after 1
minute.

### Feign Death
3 AP. You place up to six nearby
creatures in suspended animation
for up to an hour. (You may only
cast the spell on yourself or willing
allies.) Creatures in this state
cannot see, feel, speak, or move,
but they remain semiconscious and
can hear what is happening around
them.

Affected creatures become cold
to the touch, and their pulse is
undetectable, appearing to be dead
to onlookers. Only magic can reveal
the ruse. Affected creatures wake
immediately if they are harmed and
may choose to wake at any time.

### Reshape
4 AP. You touch a creature,
reshaping their facial appearance.
You can make them look older,
younger, or like a completely
different person. If you are
making them look like a specific
person, you must be able to see a
reference of their face while you are
casting the spell.

The transformation is permanent
and can only be reversed with
the Restore spell or by casting
Reshape again.

### Lifelink
4 AP. You entwine the life-force of
two nearby creatures. Choose one
each time you use this ability:

Option A: two-way link: When either
of the linked creatures is dealt
damage, the damage is also dealt
to the other creature. This does
not include damage that hits the
creatures simultaneously (like an
area-of-effect spell).

Option B: one-way link: Choose one
of the linked creatures. Any time
damage is dealt to this creature, it
is also dealt to the other.

Option C: leyline: When either of
the linked creatures is healed, the
other creature receives the same
amount of healing.

## Necromancy
Necromancy learning path:
Deathsense, Commune with the
Dead, Reanimate, Reinstate the
Dead.

### Deathsense
Option A: 0 AP. You naturally sense
whether any remnants of the dead
(spirit creatures) are nearby, but not
their positions. The Guide will notify
you when this sense is triggered.

Option B: 1 AP. You sense whether
any sentient creatures have died
nearby and how long ago they died.
You can sense the location where
any creatures died, as well as the
general nature of their death; you
sense if they were killed by natural
causes, an accident, or foul play.

Option C: 1 AP. You extend your
vision, allowing you to see spirit
creatures who are invisible. This
effect lasts until you leave the area.

### Commune with the Dead
1 AP. If you are aware of one or
more spectral creatures nearby (like
ghosts), you may communicate with
them. You do not need to be able
to see a spirit as long as you have
sensed its presence, like with the
Deathsense spell.

You may have a conversation
with the spirits for up to a minute,
and you communicate with them
telepathically. You must share a
language to understand each other.
Spirits must want to respond; if they
choose not to speak to you, your
adventure point is refunded.

### Reanimate
1 AP. You animate a nearby corpse
or skeleton, making it your thrall.
It can move around, but it cannot
leave your scene. The spell ends
when you leave the scene.

You control the creature
telepathically. It is not conscious,
and it only follows your commands.
The creature has 3 HP and can
attack for 1 HP.

### Reinstate the Dead
You touch a living creature and
make it the host for a nearby spirit.
Choose one:

Option A: 5 AP. Dark passenger.
You merge the creatures. The spirit
creature becomes a permanent
passenger in the living host’s
mind. The passenger can’t control
the body, but it can experience
its senses and talk to the host
telepathically.

Option B: 7 AP. Steal host. The
host creature’s consciousness
fades away. The spirit inhabits
and takes full control of the host’s
body. Fragments of the host
creature’s memory remain and will
occasionally arise in thought. (This
can only be used on bosses if they
have less than 20 percent of their
total HP remaining.)

## Harm
Harm learning path: Corrupt, Nox,
Afflict, Wither, Heartkill.

### Corrupt
0 AP. You grip an organic
creature within reach and create
a necrotizing wound. The wound
turns flesh black-green and
branches out from where you
touched them. The spell hits for 1
HP immediately, and again at the
beginning of the target’s next turn.
(A total of 2 damage.) Affected
creatures can only recover these hit
points with the Restore spell.

### Nox
1 AP. You touch a creature, giving
them a combination of effects for
the next hour. You may choose up
to three effects from this list:

Wakefulness, alertness, increased
confidence, euphoria, laughter, vivid
sensations, relaxedness, sweating,
nausea, chills, or irritability.

### Afflict
Roll the die. 3 AP. You touch a
creature, cursing them with an
affliction that lasts up to 1 month.
Choose a symptom each time you
use this ability:

Option A: the sillies. The creature
acts completely out-of-character in
a silly and carefree way. This may
change their goals.

Option B: clumsy. The creature’s
extremities feel awkward to use.
They are unable to wield weapons
effectively and they drop things
constantly.

Option C: blighted. The creature
can’t recover HP.

If you roll a failure, the affliction
becomes contagious, rapidly
spreading to any creature
that touches your target. On a
catastrophe, you also become
afflicted.

### Wither
4 AP. You touch a creature and
cause their body to wither. Their
lifespan does not change, but they
experience some of the effects of
advanced age. They begin to feel
as if death is approaching on the
horizon — a condition that may
change the creature’s behavior and
goals.

### Heartkill
6 AP. You touch a commoner or
minion and curse their heart. (This
spell only works on creatures with a
heart.) You may choose to instantly
cause their heart to explode, killing
them. Or you may turn their heart
into a time bomb that explodes after
a delay of up to 1 year.

If you use this spell on a boss, it
acts like a tripwire. If the boss is
reduced to 20 percent or less of its
maximum hit points while cursed,
its heart explodes and it dies
instantly.

### Perception
Perception learning path: Modulate,
Shape Senses, False Sense,
Forget.

### Modulate
1 AP. You alter the nature and
intensity of a nearby creature’s
physical sensations for up to 1
hour. Choose one effect each time
you use this spell:

Option A: temperature. The
creature feels a relaxing sensation
of inner warmth or a cool external
breeze. Or you can make them feel
too hot or too cold.

Option B: nourishment. The
creature either sees food and drink
as revolting, feels an insatiable
hunger and thirst, or feels perfectly
fed and hydrated.

Option C: comfort. The creature
either feels relaxed wherever
they sit or lay, or they cannot find
comfort however they arrange their
body.

### Shape Senses
Option A: 1 AP. You touch a
creature and manipulate their
perception of color. For instance,
you may make a target creature
see green as purple. Or you may
combine multiple colors, perhaps
making the target see yellow and
green as blue. You can also cause
the target to see oversaturated
colors, undersaturated colors, or
give them monochromatic vision.
You can choose any number of
changes and combinations as long
as they do not overlap.

Option B: 2 AP. You touch a
commoner or minion, transporting
one of their senses to a random
part of the omniverse for the next
day. You may choose to transport a
single sense: feeling, sight, hearing,
smell, or taste. The creature will
experience its new surroundings as
if they were actually there.

### False Sense
3 AP. You touch a creature, causing
it to perceive a specific thing or
a category of things falsely. For
example, you might have them see
the town mayor as a clown or all
wolves as puppies. Or you might
have them think that freshly baked
bread smells like fire. The spell
lasts until you cancel it or until the
creature is harmed by the effects of
the deception.

### Forget
4 AP. You touch a creature, erasing
its memory by up to 1 month in
the past from the present day.
This ability only works on sleeping
creatures.

X AP. You may extend the memory
loss by spending additional AP
on the spell. Each AP you spend
increases the effect by up to 1
additional year.

## Examination
Examination learning path:
Examine the Dead, Diagnose,
Curious Case.

### Examine the Dead
1 AP. You evaluate a corpse within
reach. The corpse must be intact
enough for you to look at it. (It
cannot be completely obliterated.)
After a minute of inspection, you
are able to determine the creature’s
exact cause of death. You are also
able to determine the time and date
of its death.

### Diagnose
Roll the die. 0 AP. You touch a
creature, extending your senses
to diagnose a mysterious affliction,
like a disease, spell, or curse. You
must correctly guess the entire
name of the affliction. If your guess
is wrong, the spell fails and you
must spend 1 AP to try again.

The Guide will give you blanks to
fill in that show how many words
are in the name and how many
letters are in each word. You may
start by guessing letters that appear
in the name. If you guess a letter
correctly, the Guide will reveal
everywhere that letter appears in
the name. If you guess incorrectly 6
times, the spell fails.

• If you roll a 20, the guide fills in
half of the letters in the name.
• On 11 to 19, the guide fills in one
vowel and two consonants.
• On 1 to 10, the guide fills in one
consonant.

Once you have diagnosed an
affliction, you can automatically
identify it in the future by touching a
creature.

### Curious Case
3 AP. If your scene contains
something overtly suspicious, like
a dead body or blood on the walls,
you may investigate by considering
things that seem familiar to you.
You must pontificate about your
past experience at the table to
explain what is familiar to you.

Choose three details you already
know about your scene. If you need
more detail, ask the Guide what
you sense.

You can then begin your short
speech by saying something like,
“This reminds me of the curious
case of (fill in the blank).” Explain
where you have seen the details in
your scene before.

When you are finished, the Guide
will reveal a useful clue about
your scene to you. The Guide will
choose one of these clues:

• The motive of the perpetrator
who was involved in the scene.
• The nearby location of a hidden
message, symbol, or other
detail that reveals the name or
affiliation of someone who was
involved in the scene.
• Where someone who was
involved in the scene might be
headed next.

## Legendary
### Genesis Command
6 AP. You touch a creature,
reversing or accelerating its
development to a stage of life of
your choosing. (This can only be
used on bosses if they have less
than 20 percent of their total HP
remaining.) For example, you may
revert an adult creature into a child,
giving it the opportunity to grow old
again.

The creature retains all of its
memories, unless you revert it
to infancy. The creature obtains
the basic physical capabilities
appropriate for its state of
development.

### Banish
Option A: 1 AP. You banish a
nearby spirit creature to a random
shadow plane for the next hour. You
do not know its destination. When
its imprisonment is up, it reappears
at its previous location.

Option B: 5 AP. You permanently
banish a nearby spirit creature to
a random shadow plane. (This can
only be used on bosses if they have
less than 20 percent of their total
HP remaining.)

### Eternal Slumber
4 AP. You touch a creature within
reach, placing them in a permanent
and peaceful sleep.

You may choose to tie the spell to
a trigger that can cause it to end;
for example, cursing them to sleep
until they are embraced by a family
member, or tying it to an object that
must be destroyed to end the spell.

You can end the spell at any time
you choose. You can only maintain
this spell on one creature at a time;
if you cast it again, the previous
spell ends, freeing the creature
from stasis.

(This can only be used on bosses
if they have less than 20 percent of
their total HP remaining.)

### The Bitter Gift
9 AP. You touch a creature without
self-awareness and bestow them
with the bitter gift of selfhood. You
must recite a statement at the table
about what it means to be alive.
It can be a passage from a book,
a poem, or something else that
expresses ideas about the meaning
of life.

The target of the spell falls
unconscious for the next minute
as their body rapidly experiences
1 million years of evolution toward
self-awareness. The evolutionary
process alters the animal’s physical
features and capabilities in ways
you may not expect.

The new creature is thrown into
the world with competency in one
language, a sense of self-identity,
and a vague awareness of its
past life, including a few specific
memories of significant moments.
Another way of putting it: they are
now a person like you.

The creature knows you gave it life.
