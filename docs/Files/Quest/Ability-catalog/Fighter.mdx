# The Fighter
The Fighter charges into battle
with a fearsome cry, raising their
sword to cleave through enemies.
They deftly move between foes,
countering their attacks and
enduring them when necessary.
They rally their comrades, forming
unshakable bonds with them.

You can use the Fighter role to play
all kinds of martial experts. You can
be a stoic knight, a glory-seeking
gladiator, a wizened veteran, a
meditative pugilist, or a raging
berserker.

If you want to start quickly, choose
these abilities: Counterattack,
Wild Attack, Provoke, Intercept,
Summon the Blood, and Size Up.

## Dueling
Dueling Learning path:
Counterattack, Wild Attack,
Overpower, Disarm, and Duel.

### Counterattack
0 AP. When an enemy within reach
rolls a tough choice or worse on a
basic attack against you, you parry
their attack and take no damage.
If they roll a failure or worse, you
may also immediately roll the die to
make a basic attack on them. This
counterattack does not count as a
turn.

### Wild Attack
Roll the die. 0 AP. You attack with
reckless power, disregarding your
safety. Describe a signature style
for this attack and what it looks like
when you make it.

• If you roll 20, you deal quadruple
damage.
• On 11 to 19, you deal double
damage.
• On 6 to 10, you deal double
damage to the enemy, but they
counterattack you.
• On 2 to 5, you miss, and all
enemies within reach may
counterattack you immediately.
• On 1, your weapon breaks.

### Overpower
1 AP. You use your strength to
overpower a commoner or minion
within reach. (You cannot use this
ability on bosses.) Describe how
you overpower them. You put the
target in a compromised position
until they spend a turn getting out of
it. During this time, basic attacks hit
them for double damage.

### Disarm
1 AP. You disarm an NPC within
reach. If you have a free hand, you
may take the weapon for yourself,
or you may toss the weapon aside.
You may disarm the NPC on your
turn or immediately after they roll
a failure or worse on an attack
against you.

### Duel
1 AP. You compel a nearby creature
to fight you in single combat. (The
creature must already be hostile
toward you.)

If you have the Quest Core Deck,
take your Basic Attack, Wild Attack,
Overpower, and Disarm cards. (If
you don’t have this deck, assign
these abilities to a standard deck of
cards.) Choose three of these cards
to use and place them facedown on
the table, keeping it secret from the
Guide.

The Guide must guess the identity
of each card. Reveal the card after
each guess. If the Guide guesses
correctly, you fail to use the
ability on that card. If they guess
incorrectly, you use the ability
immediately at no AP cost, and it is
automatically successful.

If the Guide guesses all three
correctly, your foe immediately
makes a successful counterattack
against you. But if they get all three
guesses wrong, you may extend
the Duel for another round of three
guesses.

## Tactics
Tactics learning path: Provoke,
Intercept, Charge, Retreat, and
Whirlwind.

### Provoke
o AP. Make a nearby creature
angry at you by saying something
or making a rude gesture. Your
target must be able to understand
your intent. For the next minute,
the target focuses its attention on
you, ignoring all others. The effect
ends if the target is hit by another
creature or if hostilities subside.

### Intercept
1 AP. If a nearby NPC is about to
attack someone, you may rush to
intercept the attack. (You must say
you’re using this ability as soon as
the Guide declares the attack.) The
NPC makes their attack on you
instead.

When you intercept the attack,
the attacker immediately becomes
affected by your Provoke ability.

### Charge
2 AP. You lock your gaze on a
nearby destination, summoning all
of your strength to charge toward
it. You violently barrel through any
foes in your path, knocking them
down and dealing 1 damage to
each of them. Creatures you knock
down are dazed and cannot use
special abilities during their next
turn.

### Retreat
2 AP. You Provoke all nearby
enemies to give your allies cover
to retreat. If you are in combat, one
nearby enemy immediately gets a
chance to attack you.

You and any willing allies can then
safely and expeditiously disengage
from a fight and leave the scene.
Commoners and minions will not
pursue you, but bosses may still
choose to give chase.

### Whirlwind
Roll the die. 2 AP. You become a
tornado of martial fury in an attack
so swift that creatures nearby
can hear a whistling sound in the
air. You may use your body or a
weapon for this attack.

• If you roll 20, you strike all
enemies within reach, hitting
them for double damage.
• On 11 to 19, you strike all
enemies within reach, hitting
them for double damage.
• On 6 to 10, you hit all enemies
within reach. Choose one:
you deal half damage or your
weapon breaks after dealing
damage.
• On 2 to 5, you hit one enemy
within reach, then your weapon
goes flying in the air.
• On a 1, you spin wildly until you
feel sick, and an enemy disarms
you.

## Camaraderie
Camaraderie learning path:
Summon the Blood, Valiant
Soliloquy, War Story, Marshal, and
Bond.

### Summon the Blood
1 AP. When you regroup, you
bolster the spirits of your party by
reciting a poem. You must recite a
poem at the table for your friends.
You can write your own or read one
from another author, like from a
book, movie, or TV show.

When completed, your party
recovers an additional 3 HP from
regrouping.

### Valiant Soliloquy
2 AP. You inspire your allies with a
rousing speech. You can write your
own or borrow one from a play or
movie. It can be short; reading a
few powerful lines is enough.

You must give the speech at the
table. When you complete it, each
member of the party gains the
option to redo their next roll. This
option expires at the end of your
scene if it has not been used.

### War Story
0 AP. Once per game session, you
may earn 2 AP by recounting a
battle from your past adventures.
You can only use this ability during
downtime in the story, like when
you regroup or undertake a journey.
(You can’t spout history during
combat.)

You must recount a different conflict
each time you use this ability.
If there is no battle to recount,
you can make one up from your
character’s past.

### Marshal
1 AP. When you face a serious test
of strength, you can organize the
help of your allies to overcome it.
The whole party must be nearby
and able to participate.

Everyone in the party must roll the
die. If a majority of players scores
a success or better, you are able to
overcome the challenge.

You can use this for feats that
would be improbable to accomplish
alone, like breaking through a
reinforced door, lifting a wooden
beam off of someone, or winning
a tug-of-war contest against a
giant. The Guide will decide what is
outside of the limits of this ability.

### Bond
0 AP. Choose a member of your
party to form a special partnership
with. They must want to form the
bond with you. You may only bond
with one party member at a time,
and the bond cannot be broken
until your partner dies or abandons
the party.

• You may now use your Intercept
ability for no AP to defend your
partner from an attack.
• You can now sense when your
partner is in danger, even if you
are separated.
• You are immune to fear when
your partner is at death’s door.
• You notice your heart beating
stronger when your partner is
nearby.

## Leadership
Leadership learning path: Size Up,
Plan, Recruit, and Attendant.

### Size Up
0 AP. You evaluate the capabilities
of a nearby creature or group of
creatures. The Guide will give you
useful insight into their capabilities,
strength, vulnerabilities, and/or
resistances. At a minimum, you will
receive an accurate assessment
from the Guide about whether they
would pose a fair fight.

The Guide will deliver this
information to you narratively.
For example, they might say “you
notice the giant spider flinching at
the sight of your torch,” rather than
telling you it is vulnerable to fire
damage.

### Plan
3 AP. If you have time to prepare
before a conflict and you can
choose when it begins, you may
ambush your enemies and take the
first round. Before action begins,
each party member must say what
they will do during their first turn.
The Guide will then resolve these
actions simultaneously.

### Recruit
1 AP. You command a nearby
commoner or minion to assist you.
(They cannot currently be hostile
toward you.) You can have them
join a fight or perform other tasks,
like watching a door, defending an
area, or delivering a message. They
will follow your commands to the
best of their ability, but they won’t
follow absurd or suicidal orders.

The Guide plays the part of the
NPC. After one day or when they
complete the task you give them,
the recruit will leave you and return
to their business.

### Attendant
7 AP. While in a populated area,
you may find and recruit an NPC
attendant. The Guide will tell you
how you find this person and who
they are. The attendant will stay
with you permanently until you
dismiss their service. You may only
have one attendant at a time.

The attendant is a Fighter-based
minion who is played by the Guide.
They have 10 hit points and can
use the Counter Attack, Wild
Attack, and Provoke abilities. The
Guide will create the rest of the
attendant’s characteristics.

The attendant is your ally and a
capable apprentice. (The Guide
plays as the attendant like any
other NPC, but you may give them
orders.) They’ll run errands for you,
assist you in combat, and follow
other orders to the best of their
ability. But they may choose not
follow absurd, suicidal, or morally
ruinous orders.

This arrangement is based on
mutual respect; your attendant
follows you to learn what you know.
If you betray your attendant, they
may abandon you.

## Body
Body learning path: Technique,
Flow, Yawp, Focus, and Defy
Death.

### Technique
You are always deadly, even when
not holding a weapon. Attacks with
your body (like punches and kicks)
now hit for 2 HP.

### Flow
1 AP. When you roll a 20 on a
basic attack, you may briefly enter
a state of intense focus. After
completing your initial attack, you
may immediately make one basic
attack on each enemy within reach.
These attacks are automatically
successful.

### Yawp
Roll the die. 1 AP. Once per scene,
you may make a show of bravado
to frighten nearby creatures. Any
common folk nearby will seek
shelter, run away, or attempt to
appear non-threatening.

• On a 20, half of all minions flee
the scene.
• On 11 to 19, one minion flees
the scene.
• On 6 to 10, one minion flees
the scene, unless their boss is
present.
• On 1 to 5, they laugh at you.

### Focus
You pause briefly, closing your
eyes and clearing your mind of its
reflexive habits. Your restless self
fades away as your body becomes
your task.

Option A: 3 AP. You immediately
use your Flow ability, even if you
didn’t roll a 20.

Option B: 4 AP. You become wind;
until the end of your current fight,
minions cannot hit you with basic
attacks unless they roll 20. This
effect ends if you are hit.

Option C: 5 AP. You purge a poison
or illness from your body.

### Defy Death
4 AP. If you would die from an
enemy’s attack, you may overcome
fate to make a last stand. Instead
of dying, you stay on your feet but
remain at 0 HP. If you also make an
appeal to your dream, you recover
1 hit point. You must say something
that references your dream — to
declare why you now live to die
another day.

You laugh at death, but death
demands a toll. Each time you
use this ability, you increase a
supernatural bounty on your head.
In quiet moments, you begin to feel
as if the shadows are watching you.

## Legendary
### Limit Break
You achieve a transcendent unity
of mind and body that allows you to
passively channel the magic around
you and push yourself beyond your
natural limits.

Option A: 7 AP. You single-handedly
rout all nearby minions that you
can see in a stunning display of
martial fury. You may choose to kill
or intimidate any number of them.
Describe how you clear the scene
of these foes.

Option B: 4 AP. You mark an
enemy, beginning a relentless
assault on them. You automatically
make three successful basic
attacks on them. Then, you may
continue making basic attacks on
them until you roll lower than a
success.

Option C: 3 AP. You briefly gain
unbelievable strength to perform
one task. You can do things that
were previously impossible, like
single-handedly lifting a giant
boulder, running through a brick
wall, or knocking a giant to the
ground. You can now do things that
were just beyond your reach, but
not things that are absurd. (You
can’t move a mountain or lasso
the moon.) The Guide will decide
what’s possible.

### Champion
Tales of your heroic deeds have
spread through the lands, elevating
your stature into the stratosphere.

You are now a hero, especially
to those who value power.
Authoritarian-minded people are
especially vulnerable to your
reputation, and most will defer to
you in reverence. This includes
town guards, bandits, and others
who enjoy using force.

You gain the Recruit ability if you
do not already have it, and you may
use it for no AP cost on your fans
or those who are awestruck by your
prestige.

You also gain the Attendant ability.
It now costs 4 AP to use.

### Steel Pact
Choose a weapon you own. You
form an extraordinary bond with it
that cannot be broken unless the
weapon is destroyed. You now
sense which direction your weapon
is in and feel a vague sense of how
far away it is. If it is beyond your
current plane of existence, you
sense nothing but a dull feeling of
sadness.

Option A: 0 AP. When you roll a
failure when using this weapon, you
may reroll the die once. You must
take the result of the reroll.

Option B: 0 AP. When you roll a
20 on an attack against a minion
while using this weapon, you
automatically kill it, unless it has
immunity against weapon attacks.
