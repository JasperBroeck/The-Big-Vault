# The Wizard
The Wizard utters a word of
power, sending a wave of force
that knocks back everything in
its path. They imagine an object
needed in a pinch, and conjure it
from thin air. With a wave of their
hand, they open a rift to unexplored
dimensions, seeking answers
beyond space and time.

You can use The Wizard’s dynamic
role to play any kind of magic user,
from a studious sage seekiduelng
spellbooks to a megalomaniacal
mage pursuing absolute power.

If you want to start quickly, choose
the Magic Strike, Blink, Sense
Magic, Speak, Pinch, and Familiar
abilities.

## Evocation
Evocation learning path: Magic
Strike, Kindle, Clap, Telekinesis,
and Last Light.

### Magic Strike
Roll the die.

Option A: 0 AP. You must be holding
a pointed object like a wand, staff,
or sword to use this spell. You use
it to shoot a shimmering missile of
force in a straight line at a target
you can see, dealing 2 damage.

Option B: 2 AP. You overload the
missile, increasing its damage to 4
and hitting the target automatically.
You do not need to roll the die if you
overload the spell.

### Kindle
0 AP. You rub your hands together,
causing a flammable object you
can see nearby to ignite in flame.
The spell can ignite textiles, wood,
paper, and other combustible
material.

This spell cannot be used directly
on creatures, but it can be used
to ignite flammable things they
are wearing or carrying. Igniting
something on a creature deals 1
damage to them.

### Clap
2 AP. You clap your hands, creating
a thunderous wave of force in the
direction you are facing. The wave
hits up to 3 nearby creatures for
2 HP. If affected creatures are the
size of a horse or smaller, they are
also knocked to the ground.

### Telekinesis
You move a nearby creature or
object using only your mind.

1 AP. You may move an object or
creature no larger than an elephant.
If you move it gently, you can
control it for up to 10 seconds. Or
you may forcefully throw it up to 5
meters away and hit it for 2 HP.

X AP. You may increase the power
of this ability by spending additional
AP. For each AP you spend, you
may increase the distance you can
throw the creature by 5 meters, and
the damage they take by 2 HP. (For
example, if you spend 5 AP, you
can throw a target 25 meters and
deal 10 damage.)

### Last Light
You must be holding a pointed
object like a wand, staff, or sword to
use this spell.

Option A: 3 AP. You momentarily
channel a blinding beam of focused
light in a straight line at a target you
can see, dealing 6 damage. The
light ignites anything flammable
that it touches, melts a hole in steel
objects, and sears organic matter.

Option B: 5 AP. You overload the
beam. It instantly kills commoners
and minions and deals 12 damage
to bosses. If Last Light kills the
target, it disintegrates into ash.

The beam created by Last Light
can be deflected by mirrors.

## Conjuration
Conjuration learning path: Familiar,
Pegasus Cloak, Force Field, and
Conjure.

### Familiar
2 AP. You summon a tiny spectral
creature, like a bird, a lizard, a
butterfly, or anything else of a
comparable size. The familiar is the
avatar of a random spirit creature
from your world. It becomes your
ally and will follow your instructions.
The Guide chooses the creature’s
background and personality, and
speaks for them. The familiar may
choose to leave you if they are
mistreated.

The familiar cannot move out of
your sight. It can pick up and move
objects no larger than a coin purse
and no heavier than 10 pounds. It
can’t attack.

Your familiar has 4 HP. It is
invulnerable to non-magical harm.
If it is reduced to 0 HP, it vanishes,
and your bond is broken. You may
only have one familiar at a time.

### Pegasus Cloak
3 AP. You bestow any number
of nearby creatures with illusory
feather cloaks for the next hour.
Affected creatures hover 1 meter
above the ground and can move by
gliding in the direction they want to
travel. They will also fall gently until
they are hovering 1 meter above
ground.

### Force Field
3 AP. You create a paper-thin wall
of force capable of preventing non-
magical creatures and objects from
passing through. You may choose
whether the field blocks passage on
one or both sides. The field can be
in any shape you want, but it must
fit inside of a cube that’s 10 meters
on all sides. The force field has 20
hit points and dissolves at 0 HP.

You can make the field stationary or
move it telepathically. (For example,
you might create an invisible
platform that glides beneath you as
you walk.)

### Conjure
3 AP. You imagine an object,
causing it to appear somewhere
nearby. You can summon any
object that meets these guidelines:

• It can’t be larger than an
elephant.
• It can’t have magical effects.

You must tell the Guide which
object you want to summon. Then,
the Guide thinks of a related
object and gives you its name in
secret. (For example, if you want to
summon a lockpick, the Guide may
tell you to draw a door.)

Set a timer. You have 1 minute
to draw the secret object. When
time is up, show it to your party.
Your friends can discuss what they
see, but they can only submit one
guess. Don’t give the party clues.

If they guess correctly, the item
appears. If they guess closely but
not exactly, the item appears, but
it has a defect. If they’re totally
wrong, a random misshapen item
appears.

## Planeshifting
Planeshifting learning path: Blink,
Gate, Portal, Dark Door, and
Teleport.

### Blink
1 AP. You teleport to a location of
your choice nearby. You vanish,
leaving behind a gentle gust of wind
and then instantaneously reappear
nearby.

### Gate
Option A: 1 AP. Bind. You bind
yourself to the room you are
currently in. It must belong to you or
a member of the party. This is your
Circle. You may only bind yourself
to one at a time.

Option B: 3 AP. Gate. Snap your
fingers. Any willing party members
nearby are instantly teleported to
your Circle.

### Portal
3 AP. You conjure a portal of any
shape and orientation that is no
larger than a door. It appears at
a location of your choice nearby.
The portal looks like a window to
whatever is on the other side, and
its edges crackle and spark with
energy. When you cast the spell
again, the new portal automatically
connects to the previous one.
The portals remain open until you
choose to close them. Anyone that
can fit may pass through them.

### Dark Door
2 AP. You knock on a door, making
it a temporary portal to a specific
shadow plane. You must be aware
of the shadow plane’s existence to
create a door to it. (For example, if
you see a creature with a Cosmic
Purse, you can open a door to the
purse’s shadow plane.) When you
open the door, you can see inside
the plane, and you and your allies
may enter it. If the door is closed,
the portal vanishes. (If the door
closes behind you, you become
trapped in the shadow plane and
must escape with other means, like
with Gate.)

### Teleport
Roll the die. 5 AP.

Snap your fingers.

You and any willing creatures
nearby vanish instantly, leaving
behind a small shockwave of air in
your wake, and are teleported to
any place you choose.

• If you roll a 20, everyone arrives
safely. You recover the spell’s full
AP cost.
• On 11 to 19, you all arrive safely.
Good for you.
• On 6 to 10, you all arrive.
Choose one: you take 7 damage
from turbulence, or a magic item
you are carrying is destroyed.
• On 2 to 5, the party arrives
safely, but nobody else does.
You don’t know where they
went. You lose an item you are
carrying.
• On a 1, the spell fails. Party
members are lacerated by an
arcane explosion and are each
hit for 5 HP. All other travelers
are torn apart in a gruesome
spectacle. (They die.)

## Magecraft
Magecraft learning path: No,
Reflect, Enscroll, and Spellsteal.

### No
Roll the die. 2 AP. By uttering the
word “no,” you attempt to neutralize
a spell that you see an NPC casting
nearby. You must declare you are
using this ability before the Guide
describes the consequences of the
spell.

• If you roll a 20, the spell is
violently canceled and its caster
is hit for 1 AP.
• On 11 to 19, the spell is stopped
before it is cast.
• On 6 to 10, the spell misses and
hits another nearby creature or
target.
• On 2 to 5, the spell takes effect
normally.
• On a 1, you accidentally amplify
the spell. If it is a harmful spell,
the damage is doubled.

### Reflect
Roll the die. 3 AP. You produce a
counterspell, reflecting a spell that
targets you. You must declare that
you are reflecting the spell as soon
as the Guide says that you are
being targeted by a spell.

• If you roll 11 to 20, the caster is
hit by their own spell, instead of
you.
• On 6 to 10, the spell reflects off
of you but misses its caster.
• On 1 to 5, the spell reflects off
of you but hits a nearby party
member instead.

### Enscroll
2 AP. You create a Spell Scroll that
can be used to produce a spell that
you know. You must add the AP
cost of the spell you are inscribing
to the cost of Enscroll. For example,
if you create a magic scroll that can
produce your Teleport spell, you
must spend 7 AP.

You must spend a short time in a
safe and quiet place to prepare the
scroll. You decide what is written on
it. The user of the scroll must read
the words aloud to activate the spell
it contains.

### Spellsteal
3 AP. After you observe a creature
nearby casting a spell, you may
briefly enter their mind to glimpse
its nature. You learn the spell and
can produce it once.

Your theft gives you the minimum
know-how to produce the spell,
but you have not mastered it. The
Guide may not fully reveal the
effects or potential consequences
of some stolen spells.

Once you cast or Enscroll the
stolen spell, you forget the spell
and cannot use it again.

## Projection
Projection learning path: Sense
Magic, Aura’s Silvery Broadcast,
Scry, See, and Find.

### Sense Magic
Option A: 0 AP. You get a gentle
tingling feeling in your bones
whenever you are near a powerful
source of magic. You’re aware that
magic is in the area, but not its
location or nature.

Option B: 1 AP. You discern the
location of nearby magic and its
general nature. For instance, the
Guide may reveal that you sense a
magic sword, a cursed door, or an
illusion.

Option C: 2 AP. You study the
precise nature of nearby magic,
learning its specific effects. If
you use this ability to study a
mysterious magic item, its name
and effects are revealed.

### Aura’s Silvery Broadcast
2 AP. You broadcast a message
up to 20 words in length. Each
creature within 1 kilometer hears
the message clearly in a voice
that sounds pleasant to them. The
sound seems to originate from
every direction and background
noises are muted for the duration.

### Scry
1 AP. Once per game session,
you may flash forward in time to
glimpse your actions in the near
future. For the next hour, you can
avert failure by redoing a roll of the
die. You must take the result of the
new roll.

Or you may ask the Guide to
reveal a situation you are likely to
encounter based on the current
trajectory of your choices. You may
ask the Guide questions about what
you sense from this glimpse of the
future, but the answers may be
vague, as if you are trying to find
detail in a watercolor painting.

## See
4 AP. For the next hour, you can
see through all magical deceptions.
See reveals the world to you in
several ways:

• You see anything that’s invisible.
• You know if something is an
illusion.
• You may see the true form of
anything that has been altered
by magic.

### Find
Option A: 3 AP. Find. You close
your eyes and attempt to locate
any object you have held before,
as long as it is in your current
universe. You discover its exact
location.

Option B: 3 AP. Recall. Immediately
after you have used Find to locate
an item, you may recall it for an
additional 3 AP. The item instantly
vanishes from its present location
and appears in your hands.

## Trickery
Trickery learning path: Speak,
Pinch, Stretch, and Undo.

### Speak
1 AP. For the next minute, you may
speak silently into the mind of a
nearby creature. Your lips move
normally as if you were speaking
aloud, but no sound comes out.
Instead, the target of the spell
hears your voice inside their head.
The creature can tell that your voice
is inside their mind.

### Pinch
2 AP. You imbue your fingers with
supernatural strength. For the next
minute, you can effortlessly pick up
and move objects of any weight, as
long as you can reasonably handle
their size and shape. For instance,
you might pinch the shirt of a bully
and raise them up in the air or
casually move a giant anvil.

### Stretch
Option A: 2 AP. Choose a nearby
creature or object that is no smaller
than an ant and no larger than a
horse. You cause it to instantly
enlarge or shrink. It can grow
up to twice its size or shrink up
to half of its size. The target’s
weight increases or decreases
proportionally, but its hit points do
not change. You cannot enlarge
something beyond the confines of
the space it’s in.

Option B: 4 AP. You may stretch an
object no smaller than an ant and
no larger than an elephant.

### Undo
You speak a word of power,
reversing the fate of a nearby
object. The spell cannot be used to
affect living things.

The thing you are undoing must
be the discrete result of another
creature’s effort. For example, you
might undo a creature’s shoelaces,
unthread a garment, cause a piece
of furniture to fall apart, or revert a
sculpture to a block of marble.

Choose how much effort to undo
each time you use this spell:

Option A: 1 AP. Up to 1 minute of
effort.

Option B: 2 AP. Up to 1 day of
effort.

Option C: 3 AP. Up to 1 week of
effort.

Option D: 4 AP. Any amount of
effort.

## Legendary
### Rift
5 AP. You summon a magnificent
gateway that contains a portal to
your current universe’s nexus in
The Rift. Each universe’s gateway
is unique; it might be a stone
archway, an iron gate, a humble
wooden door, or something else.
The Guide imagines what this
gateway looks like.

This is an extraordinarily difficult
portal to maintain, and it only
remains open for 1 minute. Once
opened, any creatures or objects
that can fit through the portal may
pass through it.

While you may summon access
to the gateway anywhere, the exit
point remains in the same location
in The Rift.

### Transcendence
5 AP. You embark on an incredible
quest for knowledge within living
things. For the next minute,
you enter a trance as your
consciousness expands, touching
all sentient beings within 1,000
kilometers of you.

The ordeal is staggering. You
immediately sense time and
personal identity at a scale beyond
your normal understanding.
You absorb the simultaneous
experiences of others — possibly
from billions of beings.

Your knowledge quest must be
limited to a subject that you could
reasonably come to understand
by seeing through the eyes of
others. For instance, you may set
out to learn the true history of a
species, identify who and where the
most powerful being is, discover
the location of a secret object, or
become generally accustomed
to the beliefs and practices of a
culture. You cannot use the spell
for things that one mind could not
reasonably possess (for instance,
by asking for “all the world’s
knowledge”). The Guide will decide
if your request is reasonable.

Beware. Entering the minds of
others is risky.

You may experience unforeseen
consequences...

### Planecraft
You conjure a shadow plane. Its
contents are completely illusory and
cannot leave the plane. You can fill
it with anything you can imagine,
except sentient beings.

The things inside may look and
feel real, but they are ultimately
mirages. Creatures cannot be
harmed by things you put in this
plane.

Option A: 2 AP. You conjure a tiny
plane no larger than a mansion or
castle.

Option B: 4 AP. You conjure a plane
no larger than the size of a village.

Option C: 6 AP. You conjure a plane
with no size limit.

Option D: 8 AP. You conjure a
plane with no size limit and no
safeguards. Creatures can now be
harmed by the things you put in the
plane. (That includes you.)

### Create
5 AP. You tap raw magic, converting
its energy into a single, non-
magical, inanimate object that
fits inside a cube no larger than
5 meters in any dimension. You
create the object perfectly and it is
real in every sense. You may create
anything that fits in the space,
including precious gems, flawless
weapons, or exact replicas of other
objects.

This spell requires perfection and is
extremely taxing on your ability as
a Wizard. Keep track of how many
times you have cast the spell on
your inventory sheet. The spell’s
cost increases by 1 AP each time
you use it.
