## Misdirection
Misdirection learning path: Magic
Tricks, Mesmerize, Overthere,
Mirage, and Invisibility.

### Magic Tricks
0 AP. You produce a tiny magical
effect to surprise, delight, or
confuse those around you. Choose
any combination of these effects
each time you use this ability:

Option A: light. You create a
harmless display of light, like a
flickering flame or a pattern of
sparks. You can also snuff out
or ignite small light sources like
torches.

Option B: sound. You create a
small, brief sound effect, like a wind
chime, an audience clapping, or
someone whispering.

Option C: smell. You conjure a
smell of any kind, like a freshly
baked pie or a cesspool.

Option D: touch. You give one or
more nearby creatures a gentle
physical sensation, like someone
tapping them on the shoulder,
a chill breeze, or the feeling of
goosebumps.

### Mesmerize
1 AP. You dazzle a nearby
commoner or minion with an optical
illusion. (The creature must be able
to see.) Until you leave the area,
the creature cannot move, take
actions, or respond to conversation.
The spell ends if the creature is
harmed.

### Overthere
1 AP. You make a suggestive
gesture, redirecting a nearby
creature that is currently hostile
toward you. The target redirects
its anger toward a different
adversary. (The spell does not work
if the target has no other enemies
nearby.) This effect is canceled if
you harm the creature.

### Mirage
3 AP. You conjure a major illusion
no larger than 100 meters in any
dimension. The illusion can be of
anything that fits within the space,
and you can program it with looping
mechanics. For instance, you can
create the illusion of an oasis, a pile
of treasure, or a lumbering giant
guarding their territory.

If a creature touches or passes
through the illusion, they will no
longer see it. Creatures with the
ability to detect magic may discover
the deception.

### Invisibility
Option A: 3 AP. You make a nearby
creature or object invisible for the
next minute. If it is a creature,
everything they are wearing and
carrying also becomes invisible. If
a creature attacks while invisible,
they reappear.

Option B: X AP. Add 1 AP for each
creature or object you target with
the spell beyond the first.

## Mannequins
Mannequins learning path: Splitting
Image, Phantom Menace, and
Illusory Creature.

### Splitting Image
1 AP. You vanish momentarily,
reappearing with two illusory
duplicates at your side. Your
duplicates travel alongside you
and perfectly mimic all of your
movements.

If a creature attempts to target
you, the Guide must flip a coin. If it
turns up “heads,” you are targeted;
on “tails” one of your duplicates is
targeted. If one of your duplicates
takes damage, it disappears.

### Phantom Menace
2 AP. You read the mind of a nearby
NPC and produce an illusion of
a creature they find extremely
irritating. Only you and the target
of the spell can see and hear the
illusion.

For the next 10 minutes, the illusion
relentlessly mocks and taunts your
target, provoking their full attention.

You may control the illusion directly
and have it manipulate small
objects. For example, you can have
it steal an item from the target and
lead them on a chase. Or you may
let the illusion go wild, allowing the
Guide to narrate its behavior.

### Illusory Creature
3 AP. Imagine a creature. You
create a convincing illusion of it that
appears nearby. It looks, moves,
and sounds like the creature you
imagined. It even feels real to the
touch. The illusion has 6 HP and
vanishes at 0 HP.

The illusion can behave
independently and travel away
from you. You can program the
illusion’s routines. For example, you
may have it clean a house, patrol
an area, pretend to be busy, or
give it a combination of tasks and
behaviors. You can also set rules
for it, like “Don’t harm anyone for
any reason” or “Don’t let anyone
pass through this door.”

You share a telepathic bond with
the illusion when it is nearby, and
you can control it directly during
your turn. You can make it move,
act, and speak your lines. It can
hold and use weapons to make
basic attacks.

After 1 day, the illusion will
automatically travel out of sight of
other creatures and then vanish.

4 AP. This spell costs 4 AP instead
if you use it to create an illusion
of a creature that already exists.
You create a perfect double of the
creature that looks and sounds
like them. It can fool everyone but
the creature’s closest friends and
family.

## Clairvoyance
Clairvoyance learning path: Magic
Eye, Whisper, Message, Interpret,
and Insight.

### Magic Eye
1 AP. You briefly gain the ability to
see beyond physical reality. For the
next hour, you are able to see the
following:

Magic. A faint aura surrounds any
person or object currently affected
by magic.

Illusion. Any illusory creature or
object slightly flickers, but you do
not see its true form.

### Whisper
Option A: 0 AP. You telepathically
send a message to a nearby
creature. They know you are
speaking from within their mind,
but they hear you as if you were
speaking out loud.

Option B: 1 AP. You create a link
with the creature that allows them
to respond to your whisper. If they
respond, you may have a telepathic
conversation with them for the next
minute.

### Message
Option A: 1 AP. Choose a creature
you have met before. You must
know the general area where they
are presently located. You may
communicate with each other
telepathically for up to 1 minute.

Option B: 4 AP. You can create the
telepathic link, even if you do not
know where the creature is located.
They can be anywhere.

### Interpret
1 AP. You enter the mind of a
nearby creature and temporarily
learn their language for the next 10
minutes.

When you cast this spell, you may
also attempt to permanently learn
the creature’s language by playing
a game of charades. (This happens
at the table out of character.) The
Guide will write down a word or
phrase on a piece of paper and
then secretly give it to you.

Start a timer. You have 1 minute to
silently act out the word or phrase.
If another player correctly guesses
the word or phrase, the spell is
successful.

### Insight
3 AP. You gaze into the mind of
a nearby creature, discovering a
prominent intention. Choose one
effect each time you cast this spell:

• You learn something the
creature intends to do in the next
10 minutes.
• You learn something the
creature intends to accomplish
over a long period of time.
• You learn something they intend
to do to a specific creature of
your choice.

## Conjuration
Conjuration learning path: Little
Bird, Helen’s Fantastic Feast,
Monitor, and Shadow Haven.

### Little Bird
1 AP. You summon an illusory bird
somewhere nearby that keeps
watch over an area that it can see.
It remains there until you dismiss it.
You may only have one Little Bird at
a time.

You share a telepathic link with the
bird. It will message you when it
witnesses something you specify,
like a specific creature entering a
room or a door opening. The bird
will wake you up to tell you what it
sees if you are sleeping.

### Helen’s Fantastic Feast
4 AP. Imagine an elaborate feast
of any culinary style. You summon
food and drink, your choice of
furniture (if necessary), and your
choice of dinnerware and table
decorations. You may summon
enough to feed a party of up to
20 people. Consuming the meal
restores 4 hit points.

### Monitor
2 AP. You summon a small illusory
servant that hovers over your
shoulder and follows you around for
the remainder of your play session.
The Monitor looks like a blooming
flower with an eye in the center,
and it’s invisible except to creatures
you designate. You can deploy the
Monitor to places just beyond your
sight. For instance, you can send
it searching around a corner into
another room.

The Monitor can tell you how many
creatures are in a space, but not
what kinds. It also gives you a
rudimentary mental map of spaces
it travels through. For instance, if
you send it into an adjacent room,
you will know the rough size and
shape of the room and any major
features, like pillars or open pits.

### Shadow Haven
5 AP. Place your hand on a dwelling
in the worldly plane. You instantly
duplicate its interior inside of a
shadow plane. The duplication
looks and feels real to the touch,
but it is an illusion; you cannot take
its illusory parts out of the shadow
plane.

The dwelling can be as small as a
shed or as large as a mansion or
castle. The physical entrance to
the dwelling in the worldly plane
doubles as a secret portal to the
shadow haven. You can grant or
revoke access to anyone at any
time. A creature that is aware of the
haven and has permission to enter
may choose to open the door to
the portal by wishing it. Otherwise,
the door functions normally as
the entrance to the dwelling in the
worldly plane.

The shadow haven lasts
permanently until it is dispelled, you
dismiss it, or the spell is cast again.
Any creatures inside when the spell
ends are instantly expelled through
the portal into the worldly plane.

## Mind Control
Mind Control learning path:
Bamboozle, Wren’s Delightful
Dream, Perky Profanation, and
Fear.

### Bamboozle
1 AP. You make a nearby creature
mildly confused about a specific
subject until you leave the area.
For example, you could make a
merchant confused about the value
of their goods, a guard confused
about who is authorized to pass, or
a dog confused about whether he is
a good boy.The confusion is lifted if
you push the deception too far, like
trying to trade a rock for a priceless
item.

### Wren’s Delightful Dream
1 AP. You whisper and wave your
hand at a nearby creature. The next
time the creature falls asleep, they
experience a deeply comforting
dream. They wake up feeling
beloved and forget all of their
grudges for the next week.

### Perky Profanation
Option A: 1 AP. You curse a nearby
creature for the next 10 minutes.
The curse is lifted if the creature is
harmed. Choose one:

laughter. They double over in
sustained laughter and can’t move.
Everything they hear sounds
hilarious to them.

dance. They hear their favorite
tune and start dancing like their life
depends on it.

mimicry. They begin to mimic
a creature of your choice. For
example, you can make them
behave like housecats.

Option B: 4 AP. You curse any
number of commoners nearby.

### Fear
Roll the die. 4 AP. You breach the
mind of a nearby creature to seek
their worst fear.

• If you roll a 20, you learn the
creature’s worst fear. They
become permanently haunted
by it in every waking moment.
Over time, their personality is
destroyed, and they become
unresponsive to others.
• On 11 to 19, you learn the
creature’s worst fear. You
may then conjure the image
of this fear in their mind’s eye,
paralyzing them with dread
for the next 10 minutes. They
cannot act, except to flee
danger.
• On 6 to 10, you learn the
creature’s worst fear, but they
reject you from their mind before
you can conjure the fear.
• On 2 to 5, you learn the
creature’s worst fear, but it
paralyzes you with dread for
the next 10 minutes. During
this time, you are unable to use
abilities.
• On a 1, when confronting the
creature’s fear, you become
permanently haunted by it.
You must choose an additional
character flaw. You can only lift
the fear by having the Liberate
spell cast on you.

## Mayhem
Mayhem learning path: Scintillate,
Bedazzle, Loosen, and Chaos Ball.

### Scintillate
0 AP. You extend your fingers
outward, and a streaking bolt of
sparks shoots toward a target you
can see. Roll the die to see if it hits
the target successfully.

You may make the bolt explode
on contact with crackling energy,
hitting the target for 2 HP. Or you
can make the bolt a harmless
firework that explodes in the air,
creating a pattern of any shape and
color.

### Bedazzle
4 AP. You summon four prismatic
bolts that sparkle brilliantly. You
may direct each bolt toward any
target you can see.

The bolts each hit for 2 HP. If
all four hit a single creature,
the creature is affected by your
Mesmerize ability.

### Loosen
2 AP. You twirl your finger as if
you are unwinding a spool of yarn.
Starting with a single creature
nearby that you can see, you create
a cascading wave of magic mischief
that loosens anything fastened or
tightened around nearby creatures.
For example:

• Bags become unclasped and
spill out their contents.
• Shoelaces become untied,
belts unbuckled, and shirts
unbuttoned.
• Pets become unleashed.

### Chaos Ball
3 AP. You summon a cherry-sized
elastic ball in your hand. When
you throw the ball, it bounces off
everything it touches, avoiding
creatures. Each time the ball
bounces, it accelerates slightly,
traveling faster and faster until it
escapes into the atmosphere after
1 minute.

The ball’s brief reign of terror
shatters pottery, glass, light
furniture, and most other fragile
things in your scene. What a
shame.

## Legendary
### Control
8 AP. You dominate the mind
of a nearby creature for the
next hour. The creature will do
anything you verbally command
them to do without exception or
hesitation. When the spell ends,
they remember everything that
happened.

This spell is cursed. If you use
Control to harm another creature,
you permanently forfeit your
character and they become an NPC
boss. The Guide will now play your
character as a villain in the story.

The Guide will inform you if your
use of the spell will cause your
character to become an NPC
before you cast it; you must agree
to forfeit your character, otherwise
you may not cast Control to harm
another creature.

### Peerless Pilot
5 AP. You conjure a fantastic hot
air balloon from another dimension
that can fit you and your party. You
must be outdoors and standing in a
clearing with room for the balloon to
form.

The balloon is 30 meters tall and
can look like anything you want. It’s
piloted by a small, illusory creature
that can talk to you and your
crew and take instructions. (The
standard creature is a red panda
wearing goggles, but you may
choose any similarly sized creature
you want.) The pilot remembers
you and where you’ve been if you
cast the spell again.

The balloon is powered by a
flaming sphere above the carriage
that adjusts its intensity based
on your commands. The balloon
can soar as high as the tallest
mountain peaks and move at up to
30 kilometers an hour. The carriage
has 40 hit points, and the balloon
has 10 hit points.

You may dismiss the balloon at any
time; it vanishes with its pilot and
returns home.

### Perfect Gift
4 AP. You glimpse the mind of a
nearby creature, discovering what
stirs their heart. Then, you conjure
an emotionally priceless gift for
them.

You choose how the gift makes the
creature feel once it is received.
Choose one:

• They come to terms with the loss
of a loved one, finding peace.
• They decide to repair a broken
relationship in their life.
• They become exuberantly happy
for the next month.
• They become obsessed with the
gift, refusing to part with it for
any reason.
• They love you as an intimate
friend and seek a closer
relationship.

The Guide chooses the form of
the gift to match the effect with the
creature.

### Invasion
5 AP. You touch a sleeping NPC
(the host) and enter its dream.
You may take any willing party
members who are nearby with you.
Those invading the dream enter a
trance. They cannot sense anything
outside of the dream, even if they
are harmed.

You choose how you and your
companions appear in the dream.
You may impersonate others while
in the dream world. Once you enter,
you create a new dream in the
host’s mind. The dream has two
scenes.

Scene A: the suggestion. In the
first scene, you meet the host and
speak with them. You choose the
setting.

Here, you may try to convince the
host to do something. For example,
you might ask them to abandon a
serious pursuit, to cut their family
ties, or to give away their wealth.

Scene B: the trial. In the second
dream sequence, the host’s
greatest fear manifests as a
monster that seeks to kill them. The
Guide will choose a monster that
is proportionate to the severity of
your suggestion. If you are trying
to dramatically alter the host’s life,
the Guide may choose a monster of
terrifying power.

The rules for this fight are the same
as outside of the dream, but you
cannot die here. All players entering
the dream have full health and
10 AP to use. You exit the dream
immediately if you reach 0 HP.

If you defeat the monster, the target
will later wake up believing the
dream was a revelation. They will
set out to do what you suggested.

If the monster kills the host in the
dream, the spell ends. Everyone,
including the host, wakes up.

You may use your abilities within
the dream the same way you use
them in the outside world, but the
effects are fictional and cannot
leave the dream world. Any AP that
you spend inside of the dream is
recovered when you exit.
