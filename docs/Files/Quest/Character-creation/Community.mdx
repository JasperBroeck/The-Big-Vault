Where are you from? Like the
real world, the peoples of Quest
are endlessly diverse. Use where
you’re from and what your people
are known for as a starting point
for how you relate to others in the
world.

## I’m from:
A great metropolis, a remote village,
a frontier town, a lonely island, a
capital city, a seastead, a remote
stronghold, a traveling caravan, a
hidden warren, a working farm, a
roadside inn, a ship at sea, a place
I can’t name, a subterranean city, a
forgotten nation, a mountain town,
a city in the mist, or a homestead

## Where my people are known for:
Their steady pursuit of pleasure,
their easygoing temperament, their
unhurried sense of time, treating
strangers with love, restoring
justice to the land, once ruling
a vast empire, creating a world
wonder, enduring a great tragedy,
their neutral rationality, their warm
hospitality, a culture of secrecy,
non-hierarchical relationships,
plainly stating their intentions,
their sense of duty to each other
, resisting a brutal ruling order,
creating historic works of art,
strict adherence to the law, their
commercial success, setting
cultural trends, their traditional
ways, inventing the future, or losing
a great war.
