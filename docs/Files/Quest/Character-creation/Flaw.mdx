# Flaw
What makes you vulnerable?
Nobody’s perfect. Choose a flaw to
make your character complicated
and believable. Like your ideal,
you’re free to choose one of these
suggestions or create your own.

## Fearful
You shy away from danger and
are often the last to act in a
confrontation. A fearful person
might say: “There’s no way I’m
going in first. Someone else should
do it.”

## Megalomaniac
You have delusional fantasies of
wealth or power. A megalomaniac
might say: “I won’t rest until I rule
every inch of this world.”

## Foolish
Everyone thinks it’s a silly idea.
That’s exactly why you do it. A
foolish person might say: “Ooh,
what does this big red button do?”

## Impish
You often crack jokes, make rude
gestures, or behave crudely in front
of others. An impish person might
say: “Hey, want to smell a funny
joke?”

## Oblivious
You often don’t see what’s right in
front of you, even if it has fangs. An
oblivious person might say nothing
even when danger is near.

## Thief
You steal. Everything. A thief might
say: “If it’s not bolted down, they
really didn’t want to keep it.”

## Hedonist
Your pursuit of pleasure causes you
to ignore more pressing matters. A
hedonist might say: “That dark alley
looks fun, I’ll be back in a bit.”

## Liar
You tell tall tales and love to
deceive people. A liar might say:
“Yes, it’s true. I’m very famous
where I’m from.”

## Reckless
You charge into situations without
regard for safety or reason. A
reckless person might say: “Wow,
that’s a lot of tigers. Time to go pet
the big kitties!”

## Wrathful
You are unrestrained in your
use of violence and react
disproportionately to threats. A
wrathful person might say: “Nobody
has stepped on my shoe and lived
to tell about it.”

## Vain
You care too deeply about how
you are perceived by others and
change your behavior to suit them.
A vain person might say: “Magic
mirror on the wall, who’s the best
one of them all?”
