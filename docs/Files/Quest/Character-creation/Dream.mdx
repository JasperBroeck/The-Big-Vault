# dream
What does your character want
more than anything? Give your
character a dream to work toward,
which fuels their desire for
adventure.

## I dream of:
Returning to my hometown as a
renowned hero, freeing myself
from a gang that wants me dead,
getting revenge on someone who
wronged me, finding a corner of the
world to make my own, publishing
a book thatâ€™s found in every home,
sparking an idea that transforms
the world, becoming the greatest
scholar in my field, recovering
a stolen artifact for my people,
stealing from the rich to give to
the poor, having my name spoken
by my leader, meeting my parents
for the first time, spreading my
ideal across the land, overturning
a corrupt government, producing
a timeless work of art, becoming
tremendously wealthy, finding the
source of eternal life, becoming a
leader of my nation, becoming a
notorious gambler, making every
stranger smile, becoming a master
artisan, dying an honorable death,
mapping the entire world, meeting
the grim reaper, pulling off the
big score, traveling to the stars,
becoming a celebrity, meeting my
god(s), or killing my past.
