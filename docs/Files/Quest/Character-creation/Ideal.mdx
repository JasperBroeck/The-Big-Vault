# Ideal

that will help you know what
your character might do in lots of
situations. You can choose one of
these or create your own.

scum.”

righteousness and fairness in the
world. Someone who believes in
justice might say: “I must ensure
equitable and just outcomes for
everyone.”

charge.”

## Compassion

and safety. A compassionate
person might say: “I know it will
delay us, but we should help this
stranger first.”

You cherish the opportunity to
give to those in need. A generous
person might say: “Live gives
abundantly, so I will too.”

## Pleasure

long as you get where you’re going.

eaten, but it was worth it!”
