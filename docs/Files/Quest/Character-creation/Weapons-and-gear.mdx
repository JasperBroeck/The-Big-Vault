# Gear
When you’re done with steps 1
through 7, your character profile
is finished. It’s time to fill out
your character worksheet. You
may choose any three common
weapons. Additionally, you may
choose one useful item from the
useful items list in this section. You
begin the game with these items,
so make sure to mark them in your
inventory.

## Unarmed
You’re not obligated to carry a
weapon, but in desperate times,
you can always use your body as
one. Remember: your unarmed
attacks (like punches and kicks)
deal 1 damage.

You can also make unarmed
attacks with extra style. For
instance, if you want to throw a
book at someone really hard, you
can count it as an unarmed attack
that deals 1 damage.

## Common weapons
All common weapons, like swords,
bows, spears, hammers, knives,
and more, deal 2 damage each.
You can choose any three common
weapons to start the game with.

If you choose a ranged weapon,
like a bow or crossbow, you must
also use one of your item slots for
ammunition. You don’t need to keep
track of how much ammunition you
have, but you might run out if you
lose equipment.

## Useful Items
### Lockpicks
A set of 5 lockpicks that can be
used to try to bypass doors and
other things with simple locks.

### Magic rope
A 50-foot rope that can
automatically coil itself. It can also
shrink to the size of a spool of yarn
for easy carrying, and expand back
to its normal size on its owner’s
command.

### Magic flask
A magic flask that automatically
replenishes itself with a spirit of
your choice. (Choose once.)

### Magic candle
A powerful candle that can light
itself and snuff itself out on its
owner’s command. It drips wax but
never seems to lose any.

### Kiln gauze
A container of magic gauze that
can be used to repair broken metal
weapons like swords. When the
gauze is wrapped around a severed
weapon, it welds the weapon back
together in a flash. There is enough
gauze in each container to repair
one weapon.

### Friend flute
This is a small magic whistle that
knows who your friends are. When
you blow in the whistle, only your
friends nearby can hear its sound.

### Skycaller amulets
A pair of magic amulets that allow
their owners to communicate with
each other at any distance within
the same world. When held in the
hand, the amulets allow the bearers
to communicate with each other
telepathically by wishing for the link
to be created. Each pair of amulets
can only communicate with each
other and can only be activated up
to three times a day. Each time the
link is activated, the wearers may
communicate for up to 5 minutes.

### Brell’s tent in a tin
A colorful tin canister that’s
magically pressurized. When you
unlock the canister and set it on
the ground, the lid blows off a few
moments later, deploying a large
magic tent that can fit 30 people.
Sound cannot escape the inside
of the tent. A switch on the side of
the tin teleports the tent back inside
and closes the lid.
