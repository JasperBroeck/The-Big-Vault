# First Impressions
How do you leave a first impression
on others? You can give your
character as much detail as you
want, but it helps to start with a few
distinctive features. Imagine what
people would notice when you first
enter a room. As a starting point,
imagine the world is filled with
humanlike peoples who need the
same things we do: food, safety,
love, and fun. The features you
choose may suggest a unique
ancestry, but they don’t separate
you from others. Assume that
peoples of the world are compatible
in matters of family, labor, and
society.

You can choose any of the things
from this list or create your own.
The only rule is that features you
choose to describe your character
can’t give them special powers.
