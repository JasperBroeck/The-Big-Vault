# Style
How do you present yourself?
Choose how you present yourself
to the world. Pick your usual outfit,
and imagine what your character
looks like when they move. It only
takes a couple of features to help
people imagine you, but you can be
even more detailed if you like.

## I wear:
Etched leather armor, a billowing
jumpsuit, a tightly fitted tunic,
religious vestments, nicked
chainmail, runes in my hair, a
fluttering cape, weathered rags, a
layered dress, a warm cloak, an owl
pin, a charmed necklace, a ragged
headcover, antique eyeglasses, a
patterned hijab, a silken eyepatch,
fingerless gloves, a quilted jacket,
encrusted cuffs, a feathered cap, a
boned bodice, a fancy hat, a bronze
breastplate, oversized spectacles,
a homemade charm, hammered
earrings, an ornamented belt, a
shining hauberk, an animal brooch,
obsidian bracers, a symbol of god,
a tarnished ring, or a humble tunic.

## And move with:
No sense of urgency, an effortless
glide, frenzied footwork, a confident
step, great difficulty, a reliable pace,
wide-swinging arms, a spring in
my step, a singular purpose, no
sense of space, music in my feet,
an uneven gait, a joyful whistle,
relentless focus, casual swagger,
apprehension, a heavy step,
fearlessness.
