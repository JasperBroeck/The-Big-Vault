# General rules
## Be respectful
Quest works best when people treat
each other and the conversation
with mutual respect. Which is to
say: be nice at the table, even if
your character is mean sometimes.

The game doesn’t work when
people are angry, rude, or
uninterested in what’s going on. In
the real world outside of the game,
everyone deserves to be treated
with respect. When you decide to
spend your time sharing a story
together, you should do your best
to make sure everyone has a good
time.

## Respect boundaries
Don’t say things to people either
out of character or in roleplaying
that make them uncomfortable in
the real world.

Don’t introduce extreme concepts
into the game, like torture or
sexual violence, unless everyone
agrees beforehand that they are
acceptable to use in your story.

## Let your friends talk
Everyone should get a chance to
speak without being interrupted.
Make sure you are not dominating
all of the conversation or action.
Share the story.

only play your character. Don’t tell
other people what to do, even if you
think you have the best idea. You
can’t win or lose a game of Quest
in the traditional sense. People
are often supposed to fail or do
silly things, especially if they are
roleplaying.

## Be nice to your guide
It takes a lot of work to prepare for
the game and keep it running over
time. Show respect for your Guide
by paying attention when they are
helping tell the story. It can feel
hurtful when people are distracted.
Since the Guide is bringing lots
of work to the table, it’s a nice
gesture for the players to take turns
providing things like snacks and
drinks for the group.

## Silence your phone
## Ask for consent
It is against the rules for player
characters to attack other party
members, steal from them, restrain
them, or force them to do anything
against their wishes. If you want to
roleplay an adversarial situation,
go out of character to ask the other
player if it’s okay.

## Don’t be evil, unless...
The players’ objectives should be
compatible because they are allies.
The game can quickly break if one
player is overtly evil and wants to
go around murdering everyone they
meet. That doesn’t mean you can’t
break the law or do bad things,
and oftentimes, doing the wrong
thing can be good for the story. But
don’t be evil unless the entire group
agrees ahead of time. The story
belongs to the entire group.

## Be mindful of secrets
Sometimes you will need to keep
secrets from your character. For
example, let’s say the party splits
up, and the Guide describes a
scene your character is not in. You
will hear what happens, but your
character is not supposed to know.

Try not to use information your
character doesn’t have to roleplay
or make decisions. Wait for another
player to share it, if they want to.

## Speak clearly
You will use two voices: your out-
of-character voice (you in the real
world) and your in-character voice
(roleplaying). Make sure it is always
clear which voice you are using to
prevent confusion at the table.

## Flip a coin
If your party can’t agree on a
course of action and everyone
feels stuck, consider going out of
character to flip a coin between
two alternatives. Then, respect the
result, and move on.

## Be a fair guide
The Guide’s job is to narrate
the story, play characters and
monsters in the world, and create
consequences for all of the players’
actions.

All of that power comes with a
lot of responsibility. Because the
Guide’s judgment is so critical to
the enjoyment of the game, they
have a duty to act wisely and fairly.
It’s no fun to have a Guide who
constantly punishes the players in
cruel ways, singles out one player
all the time, plays favorites, or uses
rules inconsistently.

Even though the Guide’s word is
final, they are expected to make
consistent and fair decisions about
the game.

## Help everyone have fun
The stakes in your story will often
be high, but sometimes they will
also feel high in the real world.

You might feel upset about what
another player says or does. Maybe
you feel that the rules were used
unfairly, or maybe you’re just having
a bad day.

That’s okay, but remember that this
experience is about having fun.
If you’re not having fun, tell your
friends why. And be sure to listen
to your friends if they’re upset. If
tensions are too high, everyone
should take a break and come back
to the game later.

Always remember: Quest is not
about winning or losing; it’s about
spending quality time with your
friends.

Imagine: Four adventurers climb
magical steps in an ancient hall
of heroes in the sky. Their torches
warm the chipped stone faces
of legendary ancestors between
columns that stretch into the clouds
below. The ranger peers down at
the sky as magic steps appear
in front of her as she walks. The
fighter closes their eyes nervously
and tugs on the robe of the wizard
for safety.
