# Buying things
Basic goods
You can meet your basic needs in
most places without having to pay
for them. This includes things of
average quality that your character
needs as a matter of routine, like
food and drink, a modest dwelling,
and inexpensive items, like the
things that stock the shelves of a
convenience store.
Here are some examples of basic
items that you can get most places
without paying for them:
• A modest meal at a restaurant.
• An average dwelling, like an
apartment.
• Room and board at an inn.
• Riding fare for public transit.
• Common clothes.
• Mundane items, like string, ink,
postage, candles, firewood,
groceries, and small tools.
There’s no exhaustive list of what
counts as a basic good, and what
qualifies depends on the context of
your scene. For example, if you’re
in a hostile town where the locals
really don’t like you, they may try to
charge you for things that you can
get for free elsewhere. The Guide
is responsible for deciding whether
something you want qualifies as a
basic good.
Trading
If you want something valuable, like
a shiny sword from a merchant or
a room in a fancy hotel, you might
have to trade one of your own
valuable possessions for it. There is
no money in Quest, only the items
of value that you carry.
To get something from an NPC, you
can offer something in exchange.
It can be one of your own items or
something intangible, like a favor,
a promise, or your labor. The NPC
may accept or reject your offer, or
try to negotiate with you.
If you get stuck in a negotiation,
you can ask the Guide to let you
roll the die to see if your offer
succeeds.
Trading is based on
communication, perception, and
feelings. There’s no definitive guide
to the value of items, only what
people want and how much they
want it.
Inventory
Use the character worksheet to
track your hit points, adventure
points, and the items in your
inventory.
You’re free to stash things
anywhere, like on a horse or in your
home, but your character can only
personally carry a total of 12 things.
Each of your 12 things should be
reasonably able to fit in a backpack
or on your person. You can choose
any configuration of packs, but
altogether, they can only hold 12
things.
If something is a kit, like a sewing
or first aid kit, it only counts as one
thing. The outfit you’re wearing
and miscellaneous items that are
mundane and near-weightless,
like a personal letter, a pen, or a
decorative pin, don’t count against
your limit.
The Guide is responsible for
deciding what counts against your
inventory limit.
