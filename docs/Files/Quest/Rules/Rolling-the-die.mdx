# Rolling the Die
You roll the die in Quest to let fate
decide what happens next. The
guide will ask you to roll when you
try to do something risky or when a
bit of chance makes things fun.
You must roll every time you make
a basic attack. A basic attack is
when you say you use your body
or a weapon to attack something
without using a special ability.
After you roll, look at the number
on top of the die. Then compare
the result to the table of outcomes.
The guide decides what the
consequences are. You may find
fortune! But if things go badly, you
will suffer a setback. You might lose
your belongings, accidentally harm
a friend, or face a painful choice.
Table of outcomes
20: If the result is 20, you have
scored a triumph. This is an
exciting moment. You automatically
succeed at what you were trying to
do, and you may even find added
fortune. If you’re dealing damage,
double it.
11 to 19: If the result is between
11 and 19, you have scored a
success. You accomplish what
you were trying to do without any
compromises. If you’re dealing
damage, you deal the standard
amount.
6 to 10: If the result is between 6
and 10, you face a tough choice.
You succeed in your action, but
there’s a cost. The guide will
give you a choice between two
setbacks.
2 to 5: If the result is between 2
and 5, you fail, and you will face a
setback of the guide’s choice. You
might lose equipment, take damage
from an enemy counterattack, or
face some other misfortune.
1: If you roll a 1, it’s a catastrophe.
You automatically fail, and you may
suffer a severe setback.
