# How to play

You play the game by having a
conversation with your friends. It
begins like this:
First, the guide describes your
scene to help you imagine the world
and what is happening nearby.
Next, you say what your character
does. You can do anything you
want, like talk to other characters,
attack, or use one of your special
abilities. Then, the guide imagines
what happens next and describes
the scene again.
Here’s an example of how that
might sound in conversation at the
table.
The guide says: “You hear the trees
rustle as the ground rumbles. Birds
jump from the canopy and flee the
forest. Suddenly, a mighty bear
bursts through the trees! What do
you do?”
The adventurer says: “I take out
my magic hammer and attack. This
furry menace picked the wrong day
to mess with me.”
The guide says: “Okay, roll the
die. Nice! That’s a success. What
does it look like when you strike the
bear?”
