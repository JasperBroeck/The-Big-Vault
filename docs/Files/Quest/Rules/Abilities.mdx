# abilities
In the next chapter, you will choose
from one of eight roles. Each role
has a unique set of abilities that let
you do special things. If you were
a superhero, these would be your
signature powers.

You can do anything in Quest, so
don’t feel limited to only using your
abilities. Think of your abilities as
ways to take control of a scene.
Some are exceptionally powerful
and can dramatically affect your
story.

You’ll spend Adventure Points, also
called AP, to activate your most
powerful abilities.
You can learn what each ability
does in the Ability Catalog.

## Adventure points
Some of your abilities are so
powerful and taxing that you can
only use them occasionally. To use
these abilities, you will spend AP.
If an ability has an adventure point
cost, you must spend AP every time
you use it.

You begin the game with 10 AP.
You earn 5 AP at the end of each
game session as a reward for
spending time with your friends.

The guide may also award players
with AP for roleplaying well, solving
puzzles, defeating villains, reaching
goals, or encouraging fun.
Adventure points don’t recharge.
Once you spend them, they’re gone
until you earn some more.

## Growth
You and your companions will begin
on the verge of a great adventure.
You begin the game with 6 abilities
from the Ability Catalog.

Each ability is part of a learning
path, and you must learn new
abilities in order. Abilities become
more powerful as you travel further
down each path. You can choose
abilities from any path, and you
don’t have to complete a learning
path before choosing abilities from
a different path.

Each time you end a session of
Quest, you may choose a new
ability that you can use the next
time you play. If you play long
enough, you can learn all of the
abilities for your role.
