# Action Scenes
Imagine: A giant eagle screams
with fury on the edge of a mountain
cliff, threatening an adventuring
party. A woman with a flowing robe
swirls her gnarled wooden staff in
the air, producing a twisting cone
of flame. A fighter with scarred
armor jumps into the fray. A healer
pulls their friend up from the ledge,
saving them from a perilous fall.
Usually, the action in the game will
flow freely while players speak, act,
and think about what to do next.
But in an action scene, the players
take turns. During a turn, your
character can move around and do
one thing.
Your one thing can be a special
ability you have or something else
you imagine, like helping a friend
to their feet, attacking an enemy, or
trying to break through a door.
The guide decides whose turn it is
based on what’s happening in the
story. They’ll call on you when it’s
your turn.
When each member of the party
has taken a turn, the party has
completed a round. Then, the guide
gets a round of turns for all of the
creatures they control.
