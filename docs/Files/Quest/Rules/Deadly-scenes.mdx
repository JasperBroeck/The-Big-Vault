# Deadly Scenes
Your character’s mortality is
measured by a number called Hit
Points, or HP. It’s simple: you lose
hit points when you are harmed,
like if you get stuck by a sword. We
also call this damage.
Bad things happen if you run out
of HP. If you are damaged while at
0 hit points, there’s a chance you’ll
die.
Fortunately, you’re also deadly.
Your basic unarmed attacks (like
punches and kicks) deal 1 damage.
Most common weapons, like
swords and bows, deal 2 damage.
Harm and recovery
You lose hit points when you are
damaged by weapons, spells, and
other things that can cause harm.
For example, you can lose 2 HP
from being hit by a sword, while
standing in a dragon’s fiery breath
might damage you for 6 HP.
You begin with 10 HP. This is the
maximum amount of HP you can
have.
Regroup
When you rest for a short time with
no enemies nearby, you regain
up to the halfway point of your
maximum hit points. For example,
if you regroup while at 3 HP, you
would recover 2 HP. If you regroup
while at 0 HP, you would recover 5
HP.
Rest
When you complete a full night’s
rest while in a safe place, you
recover all of your hit points.
Injury and death
You can’t be seriously hurt until you
run out of hit points. But when you
drop to 0 HP, you are at death’s
door. You can’t go below 0 HP,
but you will remain there until you
regroup, rest, or heal.
If you are hit while you are already
at 0 HP, roll the die. If the result is
equal to or less than the hit, your
character dies. For example, if a
sword hits you for 2 HP while at
death’s door, you are killed if you
roll a 1 or a 2. If you survive a death
roll, you might still fall unconscious
or even receive a permanent injury.
Losing a character doesn’t have
to mean you are out of the game.
If the story isn’t finished, you may
start a new character and rejoin the
game when it makes sense for the
party to meet someone new.
