# Scenes
You might find yourself in a bustling
bazaar, a castle in the clouds, or a
dark dungeon. Use what you sense
in each scene to help you decide
what to do.

If there’s grease on the ground, you
might slip on it. If a monster is three
times your size, it might be able
to pick you up. If the sky is dark, a
storm may be coming.

Always think about the details the
guide gives you, and ask for more if
you need it. You can start by asking
what you sense, like “What does it
smell like in here?”

Or you can ask something more
specific, like “Is there anything I can
set on fire?”

## How to do things
Doing things is simple: just say
what your character does. If you
want to open a door, say that
you open it. If you want to talk to
another character, start talking to
them. See a good dog? Say “I pet
the dog.”

You can play your role by speaking
as your character’s narrator and
actor.

## Narrating
You can narrate for your character
by telling everyone what they’re
doing. You might describe how your
character moves across a room or
what their facial expressions look
like when they react to something.
Or you might describe how
something makes them feel.

## Acting
When you speak as your character,
you are the actor in a movie,
saying their lines. You can talk to
your companions this way, or any
other creature you encounter in the
game.

Your character will seem most
interesting and believable when you
use a mix of narrating and acting.
Staying in character helps keep the
other players immersed in the world
of the game.

We know: if you’re new to this kind
of game, the acting part can feel
awkward. If you are uncomfortable
voicing your character’s lines, that’s
okay. This isn’t Hollywood, and
you’re not auditioning for a role.
You don’t need to come up with a
fancy voice or put on a costume. Of
course, you can if you want to.

Everyone feels a little awkward at
first, but eventually, you and your
character will form a bond that feels
natural.

## What to do
This game is about imagining
scenes in a fantasy world, then
deciding how your character
responds to them. You can do
anything in Quest, but here are
some things you might do often:

• Investigate the scene by asking
questions to the guide.
• Describe how your character
feels, or say what they’re
thinking.
• Talk to your fellow party
members, or say what they’re
thinking.
• Make attacks on your
adversaries with your weapons.
• Use your special abilities.

When you create a character, you’ll
choose personality traits like what
they believe in, what their flaws are,
and what they want to achieve. Use
these traits when you th ink about
what your character would do in
each scene.

Think of your character like a real
person. Pay attention to what’s
happening around them, and think
about how the world affects them.

Take time to talk to your
companions. Express your
emotions. Question your allies. Tell
a joke or a story. You will find the
game’s heated moments will mean
more to you when you take time
to explore the possibilities of each
scene and use your character’s
voice.

But don’t feel pressure to do the
“right” thing in each situation.
The story will be more fun and
interesting if you do what you think
your character would do, even if it
results in a setback.
