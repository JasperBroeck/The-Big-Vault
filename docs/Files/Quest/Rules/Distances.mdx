# Distances
Imagine this: it’s your turn, and you
sense a mischievous monster. So
you ask the guide if it’s possible for
you to hit it.
In reach: If the monster is in reach,
you can touch or hit it from where
you stand.
Nearby: If the monster is nearby,
you can move to be within reach of
it during your turn.
In range: If the monster is in range,
you can hit it with a ranged attack
this turn.
Too far: If the monster is too far, it’s
beyond your range this turn. You’ll
have to get closer.
