## Stage 1
In the city of seabridge, there has always been a big Lighthouse owned by the park ranger but lived in by the current lightkeeper. The lightkeeper's task is just to make sure the light works every day. The Lighthouse has been there for almost a century but about 20 years ago, the lights suddenly turned off and never turned on again, nobody dares to go fiddle with it and thus it's been dark for 20 years now.

## Stage 2
Now just a couple of days ago, the light suddenly turned on again and the park ranger repported whispering comming from the forrest and the lighthouse itself. He also mentioned something about a big golden key that appeared in the door of the lighthouse.
