### Introductie
Leg de nieuwe wereld uit aan de spelers en leg de situatie uit
### Stage 1
In the city of seabridge, there has always been a big Lighthouse owned by the park ranger but lived in by the current lightkeeper. The lightkeeper's task is just to make sure the light works every day. The Lighthouse has been there for almost a century but about 20 years ago, the lights suddenly turned off and never turned on again, nobody dares to go fiddle with it and thus it's been dark for 20 years now.

### Stage 2
Now just a couple of days ago, the light suddenly turned on again and the park ranger repported whispering comming from the forrest and the lighthouse itself. He also mentioned something about a big golden key that appeared in the door of the lighthouse. The people in the village all are a little concerned about this since there were already some myths of the lighthouse being haunted going around before all of this.

### Stage 3
The latest Lightkeeper was Tom, a young man that had a passion for everything nature, he lived in the lighthouse but once just disappeared, after giant rescue actions he still isn't found. There are rumors that he might have had a deal with the evil god of the sea, this pact might have been the reason that this everything happened. The pact would be about that Tom guaranteed the seagod to keep the light on in return for guaranteed safety to all transport on this sea.
Now, the players have some options to collect information. The options are:
- Asking Gwen
- Asking Calder
- Looking into Tom's journal

### Stage 4 (DM Only)
There is a secret person that keeps the lighthouse now and is sometimes seen in the top of tbe lighthouse, the person (Cooper) does this because he thinks this might bring the safety on the sea back for since the pact has been broken there has been more and more storms and shipwrecks. This is partually true but because the storms are stopping a bit but the shipwrecks don't, he also says that he sometimes gets these big visions of a top down view on the bright shiny ocean with a big glowing orb all the way on the bottom. Taking this orb out of the water will sumon the seagod as a human like being, this would make the players able to communicate with the god. The god is pretty easy and just wants someone to keep the light everyday with no exceptions. But the way there isn't that easy, the way there is full of fights because there is some sort of alliance of bas ships that surounds the orbs.
