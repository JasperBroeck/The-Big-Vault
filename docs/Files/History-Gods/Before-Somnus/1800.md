# **1,800 BS - The Awakening:**

- **Rise of Scholars:** As tribes continue to exist in relative isolation, a group of individuals known as the "Seekers of Wisdom" emerge. These seekers are drawn from various tribes and are united by their shared curiosity about the world and its mysteries. They begin to exchange knowledge, attempting to piece together the fragmented history of Eldoria.
- **The First Scrolls:** Seekers of Wisdom pioneer the creation of the first written language. They develop rudimentary scripts and symbols, enabling them to record their findings and share them with others. These early scrolls contain insights into the land's geography, the tribes' beliefs, and the legends of the Primordials.
- **Magic's Evolution:** The Seekers' collaboration leads to a deeper understanding of magic. By sharing their experiences and comparing their magical abilities, they discover that certain individuals possess affinities for specific elements. These elemental affinities become the foundation for more sophisticated magic systems in the future.
- **Elemental Colleges:** Seekers of Wisdom establish the first elemental colleges in central locations accessible to multiple tribes. These colleges become centers of learning and magic, where individuals with elemental affinities gather to study and develop their magical abilities. The Seekers' teachings help elevate magical understanding beyond simple rituals.
- **Cross-Tribal Alliances:** The emergence of the elemental colleges encourages tribes to form alliances with those who share the same elemental affinities. These alliances enable greater sharing of knowledge, resources, and magical techniques, leading to more robust and powerful spellcasting abilities.
- **Birth of The Arcane Council:** The leaders of the elemental colleges establish the Arcane Council, a governing body formed to oversee magical education, research, and the preservation of magical knowledge. Representatives from each elemental affinity are chosen to contribute to the council's decisions.
- **Exploration and Expansion:** With a growing interest in learning and exploration, some Seekers of Wisdom begin to venture beyond the tribal territories. They document their travels, mapping new regions and recording interactions with previously unknown tribes and creatures. These encounters lead to the exchange of ideas and technologies.
- **Unifying Influence:** The Seekers of Wisdom and the elemental colleges act as a unifying force among the tribes. As the Seekers' influence spreads, they begin to bridge the gaps between different tribes, fostering cultural exchange and collaborative projects.

The Age of Awakening marks a pivotal period in Eldoria's history, where the emergence of the Seekers of Wisdom and the elemental colleges facilitates the growth of knowledge, magic, and cross-tribal connections. This era sets the stage for the continued advancement of Eldoria's society, leading to the eventual formation of a unified realm under the guidance of the elemental affinities.
