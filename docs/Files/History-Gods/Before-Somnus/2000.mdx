# **2,000 BS - The Age of Ancients:**

- **Tribal Isolation:** The land of Eldoria is characterized by its diverse geography, including dense forests, sprawling plains, and towering mountains. In this era, the population is scattered among numerous tribes and small settlements, often isolated from each other due to geographical barriers. Communication and trade between these groups are limited.
- **Nature-Based Spirituality:** The tribes of Eldoria hold a deep reverence for nature and its spirits. Their spirituality is closely tied to the land, the elements, and the creatures that inhabit it. Rituals and ceremonies are performed to appease these spirits and seek their blessings for good harvests, protection from predators, and other aspects of tribal life.
- **Fragmented Magic Understanding:** Magic is a rare and mysterious force during this time. Only a few individuals in each tribe possess innate magical abilities, often manifesting as minor nature-based powers like healing, divination, or control over natural elements. These magical talents are seen as gifts from the spirits, and those who possess them hold positions of reverence within their tribes.
- **Primordial Legends:** Among the various tribes, legends are shared of a time before their own, when the world was ruled by powerful beings known as the Primordials. These Primordials were believed to have control over the elements themselves and to have shaped the landscape and creatures of Eldoria. The stories vary between tribes, but they all emphasize the idea of a time of great power and potential.
- **Limited Interactions:** The geographical barriers between tribes limit direct interactions, leading to distinct cultural and spiritual practices evolving within each group. The tribes' limited understanding of the larger world and the complexities of magic hinders the development of any centralized civilization or governing body.
- **Oral Tradition:** With written language being rare, tribes rely heavily on oral tradition to pass down their stories, myths, and knowledge. Elders play a crucial role in preserving the history of their tribes, recounting tales of ancient heroes, legendary creatures, and the Primordials.

	This era of Eldoria's history is characterized by its scattered and isolated nature, where tribes honor the spirits and struggle to harness the limited magic they possess. The Age of Ancients sets the foundation for the awakening of magic and the eventual unification and advancement of the realm in the centuries to come.
