His sun-weathered skin bears the marks of years spent outdoors, with faint scars across his forearms and hands. His deep green eyes are sharp but hold a weariness that betrays his years of solitude. He wears a simple but functional outfit of brown leather armor, a green cloak, and a sturdy pair of boots muddied from frequent patrols. A carved wooden amulet of a wolf hangs from his neck.
