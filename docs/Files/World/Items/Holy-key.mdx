# Item: The Blackened Key

---

## General Information
- **Name:** The Holy Key  
- **Type:** Wondrous Item  
- **Rarity:** Rare (Unique)  
- **Appearance:**  
  A heavy iron key, blackened as if burned, with intricate carvings resembling waves and stars etched along its shaft. Its surface is cold to the touch, and it emits a faint hum when held. The bow of the key is shaped like a lighthouse lantern, with a tiny hole at its center.

## Properties
1. **Mystical Resonance:**  
   When within 100 feet of the **Lighthouse**, the key grows warm and hums louder. The closer it gets to the lighthouse, the more intense the sensation becomes.  

2. **Unlocking the Lighthouse:**  
   The key fits perfectly into the lighthouse door, unlocking it effortlessly. However, upon entering, it becomes non-removable from the door until the source of the lighthouse's mystery is resolved.  

3. **Lingering Whispers:**  
   When held, the key occasionally emits faint whispers in an unknown language (Arcana or Insight DC 15 to identify as related to extraplanar forces). The whispers are harmless but unnerving.  

4. **Cursed Presence:**  
   Prolonged contact (more than 1 hour) causes the holder to experience fleeting visions of a vast, stormy sea and a glowing orb beneath the waves. These visions impose a cumulative -1 penalty to Wisdom (Perception) checks until the key is set down for at least 8 hours.

## Additional Details
- **History:**  
   Villagers say the key was left behind by the last keeper of the lighthouse, who disappeared without a trace. Others believe it was forged by forces beyond comprehension to unlock secrets better left undisturbed.  

- **Hook:**  
   When the players hold the key, they hear a faint whisper:  
   > "The path to the Keeper is yours to tread, but beware, for the tides remember."

## Mechanics
- **Weight:** 1 lb  
- **Magical Detection:** Detect Magic reveals an aura of **Abjuration** and **Divination**.  
- **Use:** The keyâ€™s only functional purpose (currently) is to unlock the lighthouse, but its mysteries suggest it may hold greater significance.
