The Plane of Air is a boundless expanse of swirling clouds and endless sky, where the very air itself holds dominion. It is a realm of weightlessness and freedom, where gravity's grip is tenuous at best. Within this ethereal domain, floating islands, some vast and majestic, others mere specks in the sky, dot the horizon. These islands host all manner of creatures adapted to the airy environment, from graceful air elementals to winged beings soaring effortlessly through the atmosphere. Travelers must navigate the ever-shifting currents and eddies of air, aided by magical means or sturdy flying mounts. The Plane of Air is a realm of limitless possibility and boundless exploration, where the very concept of solid ground fades into the distant memory of those who dare to venture within its boundless skies.
