# Plane of Shadow
The Plane of Shadow is a void filled with small, floating stone islands, creating a dark and eerie landscape. If you fall from an island, you will keep falling forever into the endless abyss. Despite the desolate environment, some inhabitants, like [[Piet de Piraat]], the Player's Guide, navigate the void with ships, traveling between the islands. This plane is characterized by its perpetual darkness and haunting atmosphere, offering a stark contrast to the vibrant Material Plane and presenting unique challenges and mysteries for adventurers.
